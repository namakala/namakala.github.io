# What am I doing here? {-}

This website is a makeshift of a book and blog describing my journey as a PhD candidate. I wish to narrate all my joy and effort in science, because I believe that academic endeavor relies on honesty. In this page, and the following pages to come, I am sharing the essence of what I learned throughout the years as I hope to entice the readers with the beauty and bluntness in research. I hope to encourage the readers to see what I saw, feel what I felt, and think what I thought. You will find several resources I neatly arranged in the [learning space](docs/learning-space/index.qmd), where I note down topics that enriched my research.

# What are *you* doing here? {-}

I will leave the answer to this question at your discretion. Though, if you are ~~un~~happy with my work, I would always warmly welcome any critique, thought, and suggestion. This site is equipped with [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) and [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/), so anyone should be able to jot their ideas down in any place they deem fitting.  To annotate or highlight using hypothes.is, you simply need to block a text with the cursor, as shown below.

In an increasingly complex and challenging world, the human capacity for resilience has emerged as a critical factor in navigating adversity and safeguarding mental well-being. This study delves into the intricate relationship between stress, resilience, and three prevalent mental health outcomes. While stress is an unavoidable component of modern life, our ability to adapt and recover from its effects is not uniform. We are particularly interested in understanding how resilience protects individuals from the debilitating mental health consequences of stress.

Drawing upon empirical evidence and established theoretical frameworks, this study seeks to delineate the specific moderating role of resilience. Our core hypothesis is that higher levels of resilience will weaken the linear association between stress exposure and the severity of depression, anxiety, and burnout. By examining this critical interplay, we aim to move beyond simply identifying risk factors for mental health problems. Instead, our goal is to highlight a powerful protective factor that can be fostered and strengthened. The findings of this research are intended to serve as a foundation for developing targeted interventions and public health strategies aimed at enhancing resilience. Ultimately, the author wish to contribute to promoting better mental health and greater capacity to thrive amidst life's inevitable challenges.
