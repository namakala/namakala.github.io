Bivariate analysis will be conducted for a set of continuous variable with one grouping categorical variable. For each set, a pair plot will be generated to present an overview of covariance matrix, distribution plot, and median value, all grouped by the categorical variable. The categorical variables that will be considered in this analysis are age group, sex (male/female), domicile (Jakarta/West Java/East Java), and marital status (not married/married). The continuous variables are true scores of the psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety, burnout), summary of the frequency of issues from the screening data, sum of cause of worries, and state resilience. To simplify the exploratory procedure, the presence of psychological disorders will be denoted in a new variable, which only contain `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Test of proportional difference and mean difference is conducted for categorical and continuous variables after each variable is grouped by the presence any psychological disorder.
