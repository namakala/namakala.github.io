### Sample Size for Continuous Variables

The required sample for a survey is estimable following various methods. As proposed by @cochran1977sampling, two factors play an important role in determining the sample size, namely the alpha level and the acceptable level or error. @kotrlik2001organizational summarized several ways of calculating the required sample size, where equation \ref{eq-sample1} excerpted the calculation for continuous variable.

\begin{align}
n_0 &= \frac{t^2 \cdot s^2}{d^2} \\
n   &= \frac{n_0}{1 + \frac{n_0}{N}} \label{eq-sample1}
\end{align}

Denoted in Equation \ref{eq-sample1}, $n$ is the estimated minimum number of samples; $t$ is the value acquired from T distribution, where $t$ = 1.96 when $\alpha$ = 0.05; $s$ is the estimated standard deviation of responses in the population; $d$ is the acceptable margin of error mean estimation. Computing $s$ requires dividing the number of inclusive scale in a questionnaire response by 6, the total number of deviation in a normal distribution. In case we are using a 7-point scale, the value of $s$ would be $\frac{7}{6}$ = 1.167. Lastly, the acceptable margin of error for mean estimation $d$ is the product of points on scale and the acceptable margin of error, conveniently set as 7 $\cdot$ 0.03 = 0.21.  Equation \ref{eq-sample2} is rather straightforward, where the newly introduced variable is $N$ = 10,562,088, representing the total number of population in Jakarta. Plugging in all the numbers into equation resulted in Equation \ref{eq-sample2}, where the minimum number of samples should be 119.

\begin{align}
n_0 &= \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 1.167^2}{0.21^2} \label{eq-sample2} \\
    &= 118.64 \notag \\
    &\approx 119 \notag \\
n   &= \frac{119}{1 + \frac{119}{10,562,088}} \notag \\
    &= 118.99 \notag \\
    &\approx 119 \notag
\end{align}

### Sample Size for Disease Prevalence

On the other hand, sample size is also estimable by following equation \ref{eq-sample3}. In this equation, $p$ represents the proportion of an event; $z$ is a Z distribution corresponding to the $\alpha$ value; $E$ is the expected maximum error, which is conveniently agreed to 3%. Following this formula, it is possible to integrate disease prevalence as a proportion $p$ when calculating the required sample size. According to @GBD2022, the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in 2019 was 3,440 and 3,779 per 100,000 people, respectively. Thus, the proportion for depression $p_D$ and anxiety $p_A$ are 0.034 and 0.038.

\begin{align}
n    &= \frac{p \cdot (1 - p) \cdot z^2}{E^2} \label{eq-sample3} \\
n_D  &= \frac{0.034 \cdot (1 - 0.034) \cdot 1.96^2}{0.03^2} \notag \\
     &\approx 141 \notag \\
n_A  &= \frac{0.038 \cdot (1 - 0.038) \cdot 1.96^2}{0.03^2} \notag \\
     &\approx 157 \notag
\end{align}

### Sample Size for Correlation Coefficient

For hypothesis 1, we will test the correlation between outcome-based resilience and state resilience. For a two-tailed test of Pearson's $r$, @newman2013designing outlined the sample size calculation as:

\begin{align}
n &= \frac{(Z_{1-\alpha/2} + Z_{1-\beta})^2}{r^2} + 3 \label{eq-sample4} \\
\text{For } r = 0.15: \quad n &= \frac{(1.96 + 0.84)^2}{0.15^2} + 3 \notag \\
  &= \frac{(2.80)^2}{0.0225} + 3 \notag \\
  &= \frac{7.84}{0.0225} + 3 \notag \\
  &= 348.44 + 3 \notag \\
  &\approx 352 \text{ (rounded to nearest integer)} \notag \\
\text{For } r = 0.20: \quad n &= \frac{(2.80)^2}{0.20^2} + 3 \notag \\
  &= \frac{7.84}{0.04} + 3 \notag \\
  &= 196 + 3 \notag \\
  &\approx 199 \notag \\
\text{For } r = 0.25: \quad n &= \frac{7.84}{0.0625} + 3 \notag \\
  &= 125.44 + 3 \notag \\
  &\approx 129 \notag
\end{align}

### Sample Size for Multiple Regression

Hypothesis 2 will be tested with regression models to examine associations between perceived stress and mental health outcomes using @Cohen2013 formula for multiple regression:

\begin{align}
n   &= \frac{(Z_{1 - \alpha/2} + Z_{1 - \beta})^2}{f^2} + k + 1 \label{eq-sample5} \\
f^2 &= \frac{R^2}{1-R^2} \notag \\
\text{For } f^2 &= 0.02, k \approx 6-8: \quad n \approx 400 \notag \\
\text{For } f^2 &= 0.05, k \approx 6-8: \quad n \approx 165 \notag
\end{align}

### Sample Size for Moderation Analysis

For hypothesis 3-5, the moderation effect is typically represented as an interaction term in regression. According to @aiken1991multiple, effect sizes for interactions are often small with $f^2 \approx 0.02$. The calculation follows \ref{eq-sample5}, but $k$ includes the main effects plus the interaction term and $f^2$ is based on the incremental $R^2$ from adding the interaction term.

\begin{align}
\text{For } f^2 = 0.01, k \approx 8-10: \quad n &\approx 794 \notag \\
\text{For } f^2 = 0.02, k \approx 8-10: \quad n &\approx 402 \notag
\end{align}

Having multiple sample size estimations, the higher number of minimum sample is preferred. To account for non-probability sampling and post-stratification in an online survey, the final sample size must be multiplied by a $DEFF$ variable. $DEFF$ indicates the design effect, where commonly agreed in the range of 1.5-2 in online survey [@lohr2021sampling]. The final sample size is $794 \times 2 = 1,592$ samples. Initially, a pilot study according to @Cohen2013 will be commenced to acquire 250 individuals from the general population. Then, the required sample size is recalculated with Monte-Carlo simulation using the pilot data [@Green2016].
