The required sample for a survey is estimable following various methods. As proposed by @cochran1977sampling, two factors play an important role in determining the sample size, namely the alpha level and the acceptable level or error. @kotrlik2001organizational summarized several ways of calculating the required sample size, where equation \ref{eq-sample1} and \ref{eq-sample2} excerpted the calculation for continuous variable.

\begin{align}
n_0 &= \frac{t^2 \cdot s^2}{d^2} \label{eq-sample1} \\
n   &= \frac{n_0}{1 + \frac{n_0}{N}} \label{eq-sample2}
\end{align}

Denoted in Equation \ref{eq-sample1}, $n$ is the estimated minimum number of samples; $t$ is the value acquired from T distribution, where $t$ = 1.96 when $\alpha$ = 0.05; $s$ is the estimated standard deviation of responses in the population; $d$ is the acceptable margin of error mean estimation. Computing $s$ requires dividing the number of inclusive scale in a questionnaire response by 6, the total number of deviation in a normal distribution. In case we are using a 7-point scale, the value of $s$ would be $\frac{7}{6}$ = 1.167. Lastly, the acceptable margin of error for mean estimation $d$ is the product of points on scale and the acceptable margin of error, conveniently set as 7 $\cdot$ 0.3 = 0.21.  Equation \ref{eq-sample2} is rather straightforward, where the newly introduced variable is $N$ = 10,562,088, representing the total number of population in Jakarta. Plugging in all the numbers into equation resulted in Equation \ref{eq-sample3}, where the minimum number of samples should be 119.

\begin{align}
n_0 &= \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 1.167^2}{0.21^2} \label{eq-sample3} \\
    &= 118.64 \notag \\
    &\approx 119 \notag \\
n   &= \frac{119}{1 + \frac{119}{10,562,088}} \notag \\
    &= 118.99 \notag \\
    &\approx 119 \notag
\end{align}

On the other hand, sample size is also estimable by following equation \ref{eq-sample4}. In this equation, $p$ represents the proportion of an event; $z$ is a Z distribution corresponding to the $\alpha$ value; $E$ is the expected maximum error, which is conveniently agreed to 3%. Following this formula, it is possible to integrate disease prevalence as a proportion $p$ when calculating the required sample size. According to @GBD2022, the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in 2019 was 3,440 and 3,779 per 100,000 people, respectively. Thus, the proportion for depression $p_D$ and anxiety $p_A$ are 0.034 and 0.038. By choosing the highest proportion, we can estimate the required sample size as indicated in Equation \ref{eq-sample5}.

\begin{align}
n &= \frac{p \cdot (1 - p) \cdot z^2}{E^2} \label{eq-sample4} \\
  &= \frac{0.062 \cdot (1 - 0.062) \cdot 1.96^2}{0.03^2} \label{eq-sample5} \\
  &\approx 250 \notag
\end{align}

Having two sample size estimations, i.e. 119 and 250, the higher number of minimum sample is preferred. Initially, a pilot study according to @Cohen2013 will be commenced to acquire 250 individuals from the general population. Then, the required sample size is recalculated with Monte-Carlo simulation using the pilot data [@Green2016].
