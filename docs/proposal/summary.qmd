# SUMMARY

Resilience is a moderator between the causality of stressors and psychological
outcomes. This research focus on unravelling the adaptive resilience, i.e. a
*state* of being resilient, as a buffer against negative life events. By
measuring the residual of a fitted model, resiliency can be dynamically
measured while normalizing for the linear relationship of stressors and
psychological outcomes.
