# Research Framework

## Conceptual Framework \label{concept} {#sec-concept}

::: {.content-visible when-profile="rug"}

@fig-concept explains the conceptual framework of the proposed investigation. An individual perceives stressors, moderated by an adaptive resilience, resulting in a varying degree of psychological outcomes. Any medication taken during the course of observable diagnosis is presumed to affect the mental health, which in return influence the resilience. The theoretical remarks of resilience is further investigated in a scoping review (denoted by `#1` in the conceptual framework figure), conducted following the methods in [-@sec-scoping.rev]. The trend of medication uses (`#2`) is investigated following the methods in [-@sec-med].  Psychological outcomes (`#3`) are investigated following the methods in [-@sec-psych.method]. The methods measuring impacts of medication uses to mental resilience (`#4`) is described in section [-@sec-cost]. Lastly, the methods delineating the overall theoretical remarks (`#5`) is defined in section [-@sec-survey].

## Research Hypothesis

The proposed research encompasses five main topics of interest, and the
hypotheses are ordered accordingly. For brevity, this section only enlist the
alternative hypotheses for each topic of interest.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="rug"}

1. Scoping review on resilience and mental health  
   *H~1~:* Resilience acts as a moderator of stressors and psychological
   outcomes.
1. Exploring the trend of medication uses   
   *H~1~:* There exists a seasonal pattern on the overtime trend of
   psychopharmaca uses.
1. Exploring the mental health profile before and during the pandemic  
   *H~1~:* The health perception is nuanced towards the change of environmental
   stressors and moderated by individual traits.
1. Cost-effectiveness analysis of policy measures to increase resilience  
   *H~1~:* Policies acting on institutional entities influence individual
   resilience.
1. Survey on mental resilience, burnout, and depression  
   *H~1~:* The resilient state is a moderator of stressor and psychological
   disorders.

1. What is the association between outcome-based resilience, measured via residual approach, and state resilience, measured with CD-RISC?  
   *H~1~: Outcome-based resilience is positively correlated with the state resilience.*
1. What is the association between perceived stress and each mental health outcome: depression, anxiety, and burnout?
   *H~1~: Perceived stress is linearly associated with each mental health outcome.*
1. Does state resilience moderate the association between stress and depression?
   *H~1~: State resilience moderate the association between stress and depression, such that the linear relationship between stress and depression is weaker among individuals with higher state resilience.*
1. Does state resilience moderate the association between stress and anxiety?
   *H~1~: State resilience moderate the association between stress and anxiety, such that the linear relationship between stress and anxiety is weaker among individuals with higher state resilience.*
1. Does state resilience moderate the association between stress and burnout?
   *H~1~: State resilience moderate the association between stress and burnout*, such that the linear relationship between stress and burnout is weaker among individuals with higher state resilience.
