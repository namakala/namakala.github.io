**Project introduction:** Resilience is the capacity to buffer adverse, traumatic, or stressful events in preventing mental disorders.

**Research question:** How do we measure resilience as a residual of Long-Term Difficulties Inventory and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview?

**Project impetus:** The lack of gold standard in measuring psychological resilience makes assessing resilience on a population level difficult. Several resilience instruments provide no psychometric information, which poses a challenge to evaluate its quality [@Windle2011]. Residual approach in quantifying resilience was first reported in children with socioeconomic deprivation [@KimCohen2004]. Since then, residual approach has been used in many other research settings investigating psychological resilience, and briefly summarized in the table 1 reported by @Hltge2022.

**Project objective:** This project aims to measure resilience as a residual of Long-Term Difficulties Inventory (LDI) and Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) available from the Lifelines data. This project will also investigate the latent profile of resilience in the population.

**Project results:** A scientific manuscript outlining resilience profile in the population.

**Outside scope of the project:** This project will not use psychometric instrument to measure resilience.

**Effects:** Evaluate the latent resilience profile in the general Netherlands population participating in Lifelines.

**Users:** Using a residual approach will provide additional metrics for researchers utilizing mental health variables from Lifelines.

**Constraints:** The presence of outliers when measuring the residual will be the main obstacle. @KimCohen2004 has proposed several methods to handle outliers and provide a better measure of resilience.

**Relation with other projects:** Nothing to disclose.
