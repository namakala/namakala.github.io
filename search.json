    "text": "Negative emotions and adversities are expected to be encountered in our daily lives, though some people seem to navigate through adversities better than others. Similar to physical immunity, our mental space also has its protective mechanism, i.e., resilience. Though there is no consensus clarifying the definition of resilience, Vella, Pai, et al. (2019) suggested that resilience constitutes the occurrence of adversity and its mitigation in promoting positive outcomes. Following the process-based definition, it is debatable whether a resilient individual relies on their innate psychological trait or adaptive state when facing risks. Nonetheless, adversity becomes the hallmark of being resilient as a trait and a state. Pragmatically, both trait and state of resilience have a particular degree of contribution to promoting individual well-being. On the other hand, looking at the outcome-based definition, resilience is the bridge between risk or adversity and positive individual experience, advancing the emotive dynamics and the propensity towards positive outcomes. Thus, it is essential to initially define the boundary of adversity and positive outcomes before conceptualizing resilience.\n\n\nThe first part of investigating resilience is defining adversity, an interconnecting facade between external risk factors and internal subjective experience. Quantifying adversity requires an association between adverse life events and individual adjustment. A statistical magnitude exists for measuring negative circumstances and their relation to emotional saliency; however, adversity could also be denoted without referencing the statistical threshold. As such, adversity can be evaluated as the presence or absence of suffering in relation to difficulty, implying adversity is a general setback being encountered on a daily basis (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019).\nThe second part of evaluating resilience is setting a boundary to what a positive outcome means. As a generic reference, a positive outcome implies an adaptive momentum that allows individuals to recover from a negative setback. When challenged by risk or adversity in life, a positive outcome is plausibly explained as the capability to prevent mental illness (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019). The presence of adaptive momentum as a positive outcome enables an individual to maintain, regain, or surpass their functional state upon exposure to a negative setback. Having a broader perspective on adversity and positive outcomes poses particular merits, including leveraging the limitation of life-event quantification and avoiding too rigid of a formal definition, which potentially hinders looking at the blue-sky picture: resilience.\nDelving into the definition of adversity and positive outcomes, we understand that resilience is paramount to adapting against negative setbacks in life. Bonanno (2008) reviewed several aspects of resilience and highlighted the difference between resilience and recovery. The connotation implied in recovery is the presence of pathological symptoms within one period of time, which gradually dissipates. Meanwhile, resilience describes the mental capacity to maintain the equilibrium of well-being in the face of adversity. Denoting that resilience is different from the absence of psychological issues, Bonanno (2008) further speculated that resilient subjects might have perturbation in daily functioning without succumbing to a disorder. Perturbations may vary from one person to another; to name but a few, the perturbation can manifest as sporadic preoccupations, restless sleep, nervousness due to certain stimuli, and sadness. However, Infurna and Luthar (2016) argued that resilience could also be observed in individuals recovering from psychological disorders, implying that resilience is not only a trait but also a necessary auxiliary functioning state to expedite the recovery. Bonanno (2008) also Infurna and Luthar (2016) brought into the table a continuum progression of how a resilient trait can intertwine with the recovery process, where a resilient state connects both ends of the spectrum. In their critical appraisal, Luthar, Cicchetti, and Becker (2000) emphasized the importance of drawing a boundary in defining resilience as a trait or state, where they proposed the state of being resilient as “a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity.” In easing the definitional burden, figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical remarks of how resilience as a trait and state contributes to recovering from negative setbacks in life. Resilience as a trait defines the scope of how a personality trait plays the role of a threshold against adversity in determining psychological outcomes. On the other hand, resilience as a state is akin to a buffer leveraging negative impacts by promoting the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Theoretical conceptualization on how resilience affects the well-being trajectory over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRutten et al. (2013) argued that swift recovery from negative setbacks in life relies on three emerging psychological factors, namely secure attachment, positive emotions, and purpose of life. These psychological factors are the core domains enhancing general mental health, preventing disturbance of well-being upon exposure to adversity, and improving the overall recovery process. Throughout their psychological development phases, children derive their attachment to the caregiver as an internal working model. Such a working model is important to integrate external stimuli into internal perception, especially in understanding social relationships. Infant-parent attachment influences the emergence of an internal working model during the first year of life, which continues to evolve and then consolidate at the age of five (Rutten et al. 2013). Secure attachment perceived by children is internally represented as a mental image of ideal interpersonal relationships. Children with a secure attachment will perceive themselves as worthy, others as reliable, and the environment as challenging but manageable. Children with secured attachment are more inclined towards having effective self-regulation, the ability to understand their own and other’s emotions, and the capacity to manage interpersonal relationships (Atwool 2006).\nPositive emotion extensively supports psychological well-being, whereas the increase in positive emotion outweighs the decrease in negative emotion in promoting mental health. Positive emotion is the required element to learn the ability to trust and display compassion (Rutten et al. 2013). Similar to its impact on general health, positive emotion is essential in recovering mental well-being. Positive emotions, even if they only occur temporarily, have a lasting impact in bridging resilient traits to improving life satisfaction (Cohn et al. 2009). On the other hand, negative emotions do not substantially alter the benefit of positive emotions (Cohn et al. 2009) nor the expected positive behavior over time (Nylocks et al. 2018). Inversely, the presence of positive emotion mediates emotion regulation against negative emotion (Waugh 2020). Furthermore, experiencing positive emotions has the merit of buffering the perceived adversity, where Waugh and Koster (2015) instigated elevated positive emotion as a strong determinant of distress recovery. The inclination towards experiencing positive emotions varies individually, but not to a great degree after controlling for social and interpersonal stressors. Rutten et al. (2013) surmised that positive emotion is rather well defined when taking into account person-specific environment and societal influence in explaining the subjective perception of positive stimuli. Culminating positive emotion is essential in aiding the coping process, which both, in turn, shall be reflected as a state of resilience (Tugade and Fredrickson 2006).\nMoving beyond secure attachment and positive emotion, having a purpose in life offers a lasting positive impact compared to a fleeting pleasure (Rutten et al. 2013). A purpose in life leads to an eudaimonic pursuit of meaning and personal values. In the pursuit of meaning, eudaimonic motives reflect an individual approach focusing on the realization and flourishing of the perceived innate potential (Kaczmarek 2017). An overarching level of experience sustained by pursuing the purpose of life promotes well-being by improving optimism and reducing the risk of depression and loneliness (Kim et al. 2021). When sensing the values and purpose in life, Rutten et al. (2013) suggested that religion and spirituality have a crucial part in their interplay in conferring resilience. Even though social interaction is the key element supporting well-being through a hedonic pursuit, religion becomes a supporting pillar of well-being for eudaimonic pursuit in a socially disconnected population (Chan, Michalak, and Ybarra 2018). Though it is arguable that both hedonic and eudaimonic motives have an overlap of pragmatic influences on realizing purposes in life (Disabato et al. 2016), it is conclusive that the meaning of life is particularly personal and bears a solitary burden. In lieu of dwelling on impractical behavioral conquest, such as promoting the pursuit of meaning, moderating the social environment is similarly beneficial to reconstructing the grand schema of self and the world, which shapes the positive emotional experience and sense of goal (Rutten et al. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Seven pillars of a resilient state, as adapted from Precious and Lindsay (2019) also Rutten et al. (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering resilience as a fluid psychological state, several factors contribute to the dynamic of the human psyche. Precious and Lindsay (2019) proposed seven main pillars supporting resilience, which we can derive from three psychological factors introduced by Rutten et al. (2013). In figure 2, I deliberately annotated five pillars as a result of secured attachment, while the other two reflect positive emotion and purpose of life, respectively.\nFirst, it is well demonstrated that a secure attachment between children and parental figures correlates positively with prosocial behavior (Gilliom et al. 2002; Viddal et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2020), mediated by the mental capacity to perform self-regulatory function (Heylen et al. 2016). Effortful control explains the degree of self-regulatory capacity to adequately respond to external and internal demands. Effortful control is a volitional capacity to generate an adaptive subdominant response, denoted as temperament regulation in children; this is closely related to emotion regulation, which we will get into later. The presence of effortful control determines temperament stability in children with the tendency to externalize problems (Stifter, Putnam, and Jahromi 2008), where aggression, delinquency, and hyperactivity are their dominant responses (J. Liu 2004). Children with secure attachments are more likely to exert effortful control and develop more amicable subdominant responses to override the dominant ones. Although Gilliom et al. (2002) only reported the association of secure attachment with self-regulatory strategy in boys and Viddal et al. (2015) further supported this clause by demonstrating a positive correlation between secure attachment and self-control moderated by gender, Shi et al. (2020) showed that in the adult population, the effect of gender in self-control is much less pronounced. It implies that the consolidation of self-control (Heylen et al. 2016) supported by a secure attachment produces similar results in both men and women. Using longitudinal data with two time points, Nair et al. (2020) found that effortful control in early adolescents correlates with their resilience at each time point but not across time points. This reflects the dynamics of both resilience and effortful control, both of which can change and consolidate over time. A similar finding was also reported by Eisenberg et al. (2009), indicating effortful control as a mediator bridging secure attachment and resilience.\nSecond, emotion regulation is an integrative part of developing a dynamic, resilient state. Previously, we have elaborated on how temperament regulation comes forth as a derivative of child-parent attachment, which in later life shall influence the emergence of a resilient state. Emotion regulation is a more specialized development enveloping both temperament and attachment as intrinsic and extrinsic factors, accordingly (Cassidy 1994). In the bonding between child and parents, children create an internal projection of the ideal world as their expected working models. These expectations reflect the child-parent interaction, starting from the first year of life and maturing over time. Children with secure attachment are more inclined to model after a responsive emotive signal, where they acknowledge that the parental figures and those around them will reciprocate with their emotional cues. However, children with insecure attachment expect that their immediate surroundings will only selectively attend to their emotions (Bowlby 1973; Hinde and Lorenz 1996; Bretherton 2013). The failure to provide adequate emotional responses will lead children into two major categories of attachment style, namely avoidant and anxious styles, expressing a polarized spectrum of emotion recall and processing. People with an avoidant attachment style lean towards avoiding emotional attachment, presenting with a dull recall of negative memories due to their inherent habit of suppressing thoughts and emotions. On the other pole of the spectrum, people with anxious attachment styles are more likely to recall a vivid negative memory. Both avoidant and anxious types exhibit poor and fragile emotion regulation strategies, exemplified by their reduced capacity to handle severely distressing and uncontrollable chronic events (Mikulincer and Shaver 2019). Meanwhile, children whose parental figures adequately respond to their emotional cues are more open to discussing their negative feelings, which in turn helps them develop a more robust emotion-regulation strategy (Waters et al. 2009). Through attentional control and cognitive reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy can reduce negative emotional responses and, therefore, promote resilience (Kay 2016).\nThird, the coping mechanism allows mental tempering through exposure to daily stress. The formulation of a resilient state is not merely determined by positive encouragement from intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also by experiencing eustress resulting from daily stressors (DiCorcia and Tronick 2011). The presence of a healthy amount of daily stressors shall push an individual to cope and survive, thus allowing for the development of their regulatory capacity. DiCorcia and Tronick (2011) illustrated improving a resilient state in a similar fashion to preparing for a marathon; we push ourselves to our limit, and eventually, we shall break through the shackles. In a more specific context, exposure to eustress allows an individual to develop a coping mechanism to overcome the stressor. When looking at the continuum space of concluding perceptible negative emotion, there are two opposite polars of reconciliation and catharsis: one to diminish and the other to extinguish. Ong et al. (2006) argued that the presence of positive emotions reconciles negative emotions in eliciting resilience against adversity by utilizing mature coping mechanisms. Crane et al. (2018) further supported the argument by demonstrating three capacities required to foster resilience through an adaptive self-reflection, including coping resources, usage of emotional regulatory repertoires, and belief system on resilience itself. Practicing adaptive self-reflection necessitates five consecutive steps, starting from having an emotional awareness, identifying triggers, re-appraising the stressors, evaluating the response, and focusing on the future. The first three steps focus highly on the current situation, while the latter two focus on the developmental aspect. Having an emotional awareness implies being conscious of changes in response to triggering events. Identifying triggers is a discriminating process to understand the causal relationship between events and responses. Re-appraising the stressor is a learning phase utilizing emotional awareness and the ability to identify the trigger as the inputs, where an individual can generate a more suitable response by referring to the desired goal. Then, the response was evaluated as an emotionally detached re-experience of the overall situation, i.e., an exploration of how to improve the response efficacy. Lastly, focusing on the future emphasizes what can be done better in the future in case of similar triggering events (Goodvin et al. 2008; Hamarta, Deniz, and Saltali 2009). The learning phase and maturation of coping mechanisms upon exposure to daily stressors help an individual overcome adversities (Tronick and DiCorcia 2015).\nFourth, self-efficacy is a result of working-model formation during early infant life propelled by a secure attachment to the parental figures (Bender and Ingram 2018). Self-efficacy is a perception of the personal capability to obtain the desired goals, directed by self-referent expectancy and self-reflective thoughts (Bandura 1978). Self-efficacy is attributable to a particular task, where an individual may possess different self-efficacies for different tasks. Perceiving high self-efficacy helps one to bounce back after failures and maintain the operating effort, supporting an individual to sustain their performance under pressure (Heslin and Klehe 2006). People with high self-efficiency are more ready to receive negative feedback and strive to improve their capabilities. Meanwhile, people with low self-efficiency are more prone to be depressed or anxious when receiving negative feedback due to their assumption of incapacity and incompetence. In a previous mediation analysis, Bender and Ingram (2018) demonstrated that both self-efficacy and self-care are partial mediators connecting attachment style with resilience. Individuals with secure attachment styles lean towards developing a positive attitude, strengthening their beliefs on self-capacity. A firm belief in oneself is essential to generate higher efficacy in managing individual and social environments, resulting in resilient attitudes and behaviors. Slightly quoting from Bandura and Watts (1996), belief and disbelief in one’s capacity generate behavioral validation, implying a reciprocation between self-efficacy and the resulting behavior. Self-efficacy belief is a requisite to fuel affective, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms in difficult situations, which in turn promote resilience (Schwarzer and Warner 2012).\nFifth, social support is closely related to social competencies stemming from child-parent attachment; a positive working model on social environment creates a stronger belief in supporting resilience. The presence and absence of parental figures determine the development of the working model in a child, where a secure attachment fosters a belief in social support as a positive working model. Meanwhile, insecure attachment causes fear of intimacy and a tendency to avoid social connection as a negative working model. The perceived working models are crucial in the maturation of social competency, which Mallinckrodt and Wei (2005) summarized as the required skills to develop and maintain supportive social relationships. Two building blocks of social competencies are social self-efficacy and emotional awareness, i.e., the perception of being capable of forming new connections from initial acquaintances and the capability of discerning one’s own and others’ emotions. Individuals with a positive working model tend to demonstrate better social competencies, whereas individuals with a negative working model are lacking in either one of the social competencies. People with an anxious-type attachment style suffer from a higher degree of social uncertainty, denoted by the perception of powerlessness and the inability to develop and maintain close relationships. On the other hand, people with avoidance-type attachment styles actively repress their conscious perception of emotion, displaying a higher degree of affective disinterest (Mallinckrodt and Wei 2005). Maintaining social connection is paramount to the accessibility of psychological and material resources provided by the social network, benefiting an individual’s capacity to handle adversities (Cohen 2004). In their commentary, Sippel et al. (2015) argued that social support is a necessary factor to moderate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities, which aid an individual to display state resilience. The availability of social supports can nurture stress-regulating behavior, including but not limited to improving self-confidence, preventing risky behavior, fostering mature coping mechanisms, and promoting emotion-regulation strategy.\n\n\n\nResilience, both as a trait and state, contributes to maintaining psychological well-being by reducing or buffering the negative effects of experiencing adversities. Hu, Zhang, and Wang (2015) argued that resilience would be best observed as a psychological trait due to its innate and stable nature. Based on resilience traits, it is possible to classify people into groups. However, observing resilience only as a trait will subsequently underestimate the actual occurrence of resilience in the population, where Gheshlagh et al. (2017) demonstrated in their meta-analysis that resilience as measured with CD-RISC1, RSA2, ERS3; their findings presented with high heterogeneity, which indirectly implied difference in instrumental measurements of resilience. On a further note, Gheshlagh et al. (2017) and Hu et al. (2015) suggested that the level of resilience positively correlates with reduced depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Research focus on either type of resilience would be a matter of practicality, i.e., researching resilient traits is better intended for grouping the population based on their level of resilience so that clinicians can prevent mental health issues in people with low resilience (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). On the other hand, focusing on a resilient state would allow the establishment of a mental health policy that can provide support to improve the resilient state. In this investigation, the author is interested in evaluating resilience as a state and its relation to adversity, medication uses, mental health policy, and psychological outcomes.\n1 Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, containing 25 items addressing factors contributing to resilient state2 Resilience Scale for Adults; containing 33 items addressing self-sufficiency, family coherence, and social support3 Essential Resilience Scale; 15 items mostly measuring resilient trait\n\n\n\nResilience is the adaptability of an individual to adversities in routine or occasional circumstances, factoring the biopsychosocial-ecological system supporting multiple promotive and protective factors and processes (Ungar and Theron 2020). Resilient individuals have three essential psychological characteristics, including secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions, and having a purpose in life (Rutten et al. 2013). Resilience is a dynamic process regulating the homeostatic plasticity (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019; H. Liu et al. 2018), which reflects a desirable mental control, emotion regulation, coping mechanism, self-efficacy, a sense of purpose, positive affect, and social support (Precious and Lindsay 2019). Resilient individuals are more likely to bounce back from negative events, either by promptly adapting or quickly recovering, to accomplish a more favorable mental health outcome (Ungar and Theron 2020).\nIndividuals with resilient traits have an overall better mental health, indicated by higher life satisfaction and positive affect. Accordingly, the lack of resilient traits also contributes to heightening depression, anxiety, and negative affect (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). Several studies have also replicated the extensive impact of resilience in lowering depression (Nakazawa et al. 2018), anxiety (Ran et al. 2020; Schiele and Domschke 2018), and burnout (West et al. 2020; Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020). Intriguingly, burnout has been established as a common association between depression and anxiety (Meier and Kim 2022; Koutsimani, Montgomery, and Georganta 2019), suggesting a generic yet distinctive process in relation to mental resilience (Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020; Serrao et al. 2021). In situation-specific distress, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with higher resilience can adapt better to the abrupt changes, reflected by lower trepidation, reduced anxiety, and attenuated depression (Barzilay et al. 2020). In Indonesia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multitude of mental health issues, especially during the large-scale containment, which halted economic activities, mostly impacting those in the mid-low socioeconomic stratum, and hindered social activities, resulting in loneliness and, in some cases, social dejection (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). The pandemic aggravates the mental health situation in Indonesia, where previously, among older adults, 46.28% experienced stress, and 31.72% felt depressed (Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Although the government of Indonesia implemented The Mental Health Act in 2014, the resources and facilities are not widely available (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021; Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Several online mental health services have been spurred during the pandemic, but further regulation and mitigation from the government are necessary to abate the spread of mental health problems (Ifdil et al. 2020), i.e., by establishing a government-verified digital counseling platform, multi-stakeholder mental health support program, and improving the accessibility of mental health services in the primary health care(Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). Considering the intricacies between policy-driven action, resilience, situational changes, depression, anxiety, and burnout, the upcoming investigations will be mainly concerned with unraveling the question:\n\n“What is the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of public health policies to maintain mental resilience amidst adversities, especially regarding their impact on depression, anxiety, burnout, and related medication use?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research aims to delineate the influence of state resilience as a buffer of general health stressors in eliciting depression, anxiety, and burnout.\n\n\n\nThis research poses five specific objectives, each is focused as a separate investigation:\n\nSystematically find the required modelling parameter through a scoping review\nEvaluate the seasonality of psychopharmaca uses\nExtract the temporal health parameter by examining the annual mental health profiles\nMeasure the cost effectiveness of policy interventions affecting individual resilience\nEvaluate the output parameters through a large-scale survey\n\n\n\n\n\nThis research focuses on the data mining process, especially to generate new insight and knowledge (knowledge mining). The tools used in this research shall be free to access under an open-source license, with some restriction to the source code of a more specific use cases, which will be protected under a closed-source license. The highlight of the proposed model is to use agent-based model as a general modelling framework using a graph object as its input. The following subsections shall further elaborate how the general framework and knowledge mining process can be beneficial for the institution, researchers, and general audiences.\n\n\nFirstly, this research aims to disentangle the general framework of agent-based modelling in a graph object. The general modelling framework will be useful in various cases representable as a graph object, especially a knowledge graph. This framework is beneficial for the institution, since a patent for specific use cases would be applicable.\n\n\n\nSecondly, for researchers, the use of general modelling framework will aid in the modelling workflow. The agent-based model can be treated as a singular building block of an analytic pipeline. This will aid the researchers in generating a more flexible model by incorporating the general modelling framework.\n\n\n\nThirdly, the general audiences will gain benefits from the knowledge mining process. Generally, this research will highlight effective countermeasures against psychological stressors and psychological disorders. Furthermore, this research will yield an insight regarding improving the resilient state.",

The inclination towards experiencing positive emotions varies individually, but not to a great degree after controlling for social and interpersonal stressors. Rutten et al. (2013) surmised that positive emotion is rather well defined when taking into account person-specific environment and societal influence in explaining the subjective perception of positive stimuli. Culminating positive emotion is essential in aiding the coping process, which both, in turn, shall be reflected as a state of resilience (Tugade and Fredrickson 2006).\nMoving beyond secure attachment and positive emotion, having a purpose in life offers a lasting positive impact compared to a fleeting pleasure (Rutten et al. 2013). A purpose in life leads to an eudaimonic pursuit of meaning and personal values. In the pursuit of meaning, eudaimonic motives reflect an individual approach focusing on the realization and flourishing of the perceived innate potential (Kaczmarek 2017). An overarching level of experience sustained by pursuing the purpose of life promotes well-being by improving optimism and reducing the risk of depression and loneliness (Kim et al. 2021). When sensing the values and purpose in life, Rutten et al. (2013) suggested that religion and spirituality have a crucial part in their interplay in conferring resilience. Even though social interaction is the key element supporting well-being through a hedonic pursuit, religion becomes a supporting pillar of well-being for eudaimonic pursuit in a socially disconnected population (Chan, Michalak, and Ybarra 2018). Though it is arguable that both hedonic and eudaimonic motives have an overlap of pragmatic influences on realizing purposes in life (Disabato et al. 2016), it is conclusive that the meaning of life is particularly personal and bears a solitary burden. In lieu of dwelling on impractical behavioral conquest, such as promoting the pursuit of meaning, moderating the social environment is similarly beneficial to reconstructing the grand schema of self and the world, which shapes the positive emotional experience and sense of goal (Rutten et al. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Seven pillars of a resilient state, as adapted from Precious and Lindsay (2019) also Rutten et al. (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering resilience as a fluid psychological state, several factors contribute to the dynamic of the human psyche. Precious and Lindsay (2019) proposed seven main pillars supporting resilience, which we can derive from three psychological factors introduced by Rutten et al. (2013). In figure 2, I deliberately annotated five pillars as a result of secured attachment, while the other two reflect positive emotion and purpose of life, respectively.\nFirst, it is well demonstrated that a secure attachment between children and parental figures correlates positively with prosocial behavior (Gilliom et al. 2002; Viddal et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2020), mediated by the mental capacity to perform self-regulatory function (Heylen et al. 2016). Effortful control explains the degree of self-regulatory capacity to adequately respond to external and internal demands. Effortful control is a volitional capacity to generate an adaptive subdominant response, denoted as temperament regulation in children; this is closely related to emotion regulation, which we will get into later. The presence of effortful control determines temperament stability in children with the tendency to externalize problems (Stifter, Putnam, and Jahromi 2008), where aggression, delinquency, and hyperactivity are their dominant responses (J. Liu 2004). Children with secure attachments are more likely to exert effortful control and develop more amicable subdominant responses to override the dominant ones. Although Gilliom et al. (2002) only reported the association of secure attachment with self-regulatory strategy in boys and Viddal et al. (2015) further supported this clause by demonstrating a positive correlation between secure attachment and self-control moderated by gender, Shi et al. (2020) showed that in the adult population, the effect of gender in self-control is much less pronounced. It implies that the consolidation of self-control (Heylen et al. 2016) supported by a secure attachment produces similar results in both men and women. Using longitudinal data with two time points, Nair et al. (2020) found that effortful control in early adolescents correlates with their resilience at each time point but not across time points. This reflects the dynamics of both resilience and effortful control, both of which can change and consolidate over time. A similar finding was also reported by Eisenberg et al. (2009), indicating effortful control as a mediator bridging secure attachment and resilience.\nSecond, emotion regulation is an integrative part of developing a dynamic, resilient state. Previously, we have elaborated on how temperament regulation comes forth as a derivative of child-parent attachment, which in later life shall influence the emergence of a resilient state. Emotion regulation is a more specialized development enveloping both temperament and attachment as intrinsic and extrinsic factors, accordingly (Cassidy 1994). In the bonding between child and parents, children create an internal projection of the ideal world as their expected working models. These expectations reflect the child-parent interaction, starting from the first year of life and maturing over time. Children with secure attachment are more inclined to model after a responsive emotive signal, where they acknowledge that the parental figures and those around them will reciprocate with their emotional cues. However, children with insecure attachment expect that their immediate surroundings will only selectively attend to their emotions (Bowlby 1973; Hinde and Lorenz 1996; Bretherton 2013). The failure to provide adequate emotional responses will lead children into two major categories of attachment style, namely avoidant and anxious styles, expressing a polarized spectrum of emotion recall and processing. People with an avoidant attachment style lean towards avoiding emotional attachment, presenting with a dull recall of negative memories due to their inherent habit of suppressing thoughts and emotions. On the other pole of the spectrum, people with anxious attachment styles are more likely to recall a vivid negative memory. Both avoidant and anxious types exhibit poor and fragile emotion regulation strategies, exemplified by their reduced capacity to handle severely distressing and uncontrollable chronic events (Mikulincer and Shaver 2019). Meanwhile, children whose parental figures adequately respond to their emotional cues are more open to discussing their negative feelings, which in turn helps them develop a more robust emotion-regulation strategy (Waters et al. 2009). Through attentional control and cognitive reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy can reduce negative emotional responses and, therefore, promote resilience (Kay 2016).\nThird, the coping mechanism allows mental tempering through exposure to daily stress. The formulation of a resilient state is not merely determined by positive encouragement from intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also by experiencing eustress resulting from daily stressors (DiCorcia and Tronick 2011). The presence of a healthy amount of daily stressors shall push an individual to cope and survive, thus allowing for the development of their regulatory capacity. DiCorcia and Tronick (2011) illustrated improving a resilient state in a similar fashion to preparing for a marathon; we push ourselves to our limit, and eventually, we shall break through the shackles. In a more specific context, exposure to eustress allows an individual to develop a coping mechanism to overcome the stressor. When looking at the continuum space of concluding perceptible negative emotion, there are two opposite polars of reconciliation and catharsis: one to diminish and the other to extinguish. Ong et al. (2006) argued that the presence of positive emotions reconciles negative emotions in eliciting resilience against adversity by utilizing mature coping mechanisms. Crane et al. (2018) further supported the argument by demonstrating three capacities required to foster resilience through an adaptive self-reflection, including coping resources, usage of emotional regulatory repertoires, and belief system on resilience itself. Practicing adaptive self-reflection necessitates five consecutive steps, starting from having an emotional awareness, identifying triggers, re-appraising the stressors, evaluating the response, and focusing on the future. The first three steps focus highly on the current situation, while the latter two focus on the developmental aspect. Having an emotional awareness implies being conscious of changes in response to triggering events. Identifying triggers is a discriminating process to understand the causal relationship between events and responses. Re-appraising the stressor is a learning phase utilizing emotional awareness and the ability to identify the trigger as the inputs, where an individual can generate a more suitable response by referring to the desired goal. Then, the response was evaluated as an emotionally detached re-experience of the overall situation, i.e., an exploration of how to improve the response efficacy. Lastly, focusing on the future emphasizes what can be done better in the future in case of similar triggering events (Goodvin et al. 2008; Hamarta, Deniz, and Saltali 2009). The learning phase and maturation of coping mechanisms upon exposure to daily stressors help an individual overcome adversities (Tronick and DiCorcia 2015).\nFourth, self-efficacy is a result of working-model formation during early infant life propelled by a secure attachment to the parental figures (Bender and Ingram 2018). Self-efficacy is a perception of the personal capability to obtain the desired goals, directed by self-referent expectancy and self-reflective thoughts (Bandura 1978). Self-efficacy is attributable to a particular task, where an individual may possess different self-efficacies for different tasks. Perceiving high self-efficacy helps one to bounce back after failures and maintain the operating effort, supporting an individual to sustain their performance under pressure (Heslin and Klehe 2006). People with high self-efficiency are more ready to receive negative feedback and strive to improve their capabilities. Meanwhile, people with low self-efficiency are more prone to be depressed or anxious when receiving negative feedback due to their assumption of incapacity and incompetence. In a previous mediation analysis, Bender and Ingram (2018) demonstrated that both self-efficacy and self-care are partial mediators connecting attachment style with resilience. Individuals with secure attachment styles lean towards developing a positive attitude, strengthening their beliefs on self-capacity. A firm belief in oneself is essential to generate higher efficacy in managing individual and social environments, resulting in resilient attitudes and behaviors. Slightly quoting from Bandura and Watts (1996), belief and disbelief in one’s capacity generate behavioral validation, implying a reciprocation between self-efficacy and the resulting behavior. Self-efficacy belief is a requisite to fuel affective, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms in difficult situations, which in turn promote resilience (Schwarzer and Warner 2012).\nFifth, social support is closely related to social competencies stemming from child-parent attachment; a positive working model on social environment creates a stronger belief in supporting resilience. The presence and absence of parental figures determine the development of the working model in a child, where a secure attachment fosters a belief in social support as a positive working model. Meanwhile, insecure attachment causes fear of intimacy and a tendency to avoid social connection as a negative working model. The perceived working models are crucial in the maturation of social competency, which Mallinckrodt and Wei (2005) summarized as the required skills to develop and maintain supportive social relationships. Two building blocks of social competencies are social self-efficacy and emotional awareness, i.e., the perception of being capable of forming new connections from initial acquaintances and the capability of discerning one’s own and others’ emotions. Individuals with a positive working model tend to demonstrate better social competencies, whereas individuals with a negative working model are lacking in either one of the social competencies. People with an anxious-type attachment style suffer from a higher degree of social uncertainty, denoted by the perception of powerlessness and the inability to develop and maintain close relationships. On the other hand, people with avoidance-type attachment styles actively repress their conscious perception of emotion, displaying a higher degree of affective disinterest (Mallinckrodt and Wei 2005). Maintaining social connection is paramount to the accessibility of psychological and material resources provided by the social network, benefiting an individual’s capacity to handle adversities (Cohen 2004). In their commentary, Sippel et al. (2015) argued that social support is a necessary factor to moderate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities, which aid an individual to display state resilience. The availability of social supports can nurture stress-regulating behavior, including but not limited to improving self-confidence, preventing risky behavior, fostering mature coping mechanisms, and promoting emotion-regulation strategy.\n\n\n\nResilience, both as a trait and state, contributes to maintaining psychological well-being by reducing or buffering the negative effects of experiencing adversities. Hu, Zhang, and Wang (2015) argued that resilience would be best observed as a psychological trait due to its innate and stable nature. Based on resilience traits, it is possible to classify people into groups. However, observing resilience only as a trait will subsequently underestimate the actual occurrence of resilience in the population, where Gheshlagh et al. (2017) demonstrated in their meta-analysis that resilience as measured with CD-RISC1, RSA2, ERS3; their findings presented with high heterogeneity, which indirectly implied difference in instrumental measurements of resilience. On a further note, Gheshlagh et al. (2017) and Hu et al. (2015) suggested that the level of resilience positively correlates with reduced depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Research focus on either type of resilience would be a matter of practicality, i.e., researching resilient traits is better intended for grouping the population based on their level of resilience so that clinicians can prevent mental health issues in people with low resilience (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). On the other hand, focusing on a resilient state would allow the establishment of a mental health policy that can provide support to improve the resilient state. In this investigation, the author is interested in evaluating resilience as a state and its relation to adversity, medication uses, mental health policy, and psychological outcomes.\n1 Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, containing 25 items addressing factors contributing to resilient state2 Resilience Scale for Adults; containing 33 items addressing self-sufficiency, family coherence, and social support3 Essential Resilience Scale; 15 items mostly measuring resilient trait",

    "text": "Resilience is the adaptability of an individual to adversities in routine or occasional circumstances, factoring the biopsychosocial-ecological system supporting multiple promotive and protective factors and processes (Ungar and Theron 2020). Resilient individuals have three essential psychological characteristics, including secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions, and having a purpose in life (Rutten et al. 2013). Resilience is a dynamic process regulating the homeostatic plasticity (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019; H. Liu et al. 2018), which reflects a desirable mental control, emotion regulation, coping mechanism, self-efficacy, a sense of purpose, positive affect, and social support (Precious and Lindsay 2019). Resilient individuals are more likely to bounce back from negative events, either by promptly adapting or quickly recovering, to accomplish a more favorable mental health outcome (Ungar and Theron 2020).\nIndividuals with resilient traits have an overall better mental health, indicated by higher life satisfaction and positive affect. Accordingly, the lack of resilient traits also contributes to heightening depression, anxiety, and negative affect (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). Several studies have also replicated the extensive impact of resilience in lowering depression (Nakazawa et al. 2018), anxiety (Ran et al. 2020; Schiele and Domschke 2018), and burnout (West et al. 2020; Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020). Intriguingly, burnout has been established as a common association between depression and anxiety (Meier and Kim 2022; Koutsimani, Montgomery, and Georganta 2019), suggesting a generic yet distinctive process in relation to mental resilience (Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020; Serrao et al. 2021). In situation-specific distress, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with higher resilience can adapt better to the abrupt changes, reflected by lower trepidation, reduced anxiety, and attenuated depression (Barzilay et al. 2020). In Indonesia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multitude of mental health issues, especially during the large-scale containment, which halted economic activities, mostly impacting those in the mid-low socioeconomic stratum, and hindered social activities, resulting in loneliness and, in some cases, social dejection (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). The pandemic aggravates the mental health situation in Indonesia, where previously, among older adults, 46.28% experienced stress, and 31.72% felt depressed (Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Although the government of Indonesia implemented The Mental Health Act in 2014, the resources and facilities are not widely available (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021; Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Several online mental health services have been spurred during the pandemic, but further regulation and mitigation from the government are necessary to abate the spread of mental health problems (Ifdil et al. 2020), i.e., by establishing a government-verified digital counseling platform, multi-stakeholder mental health support program, and improving the accessibility of mental health services in the primary health care(Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). Considering the intricacies between policy-driven action, resilience, situational changes, depression, anxiety, and burnout, the upcoming investigations will be mainly concerned with unraveling the question:\n\n“What is the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of public health policies to maintain mental resilience amidst adversities, especially regarding their impact on depression, anxiety, burnout, and related medication use?”",

As proposed by Cochran (1977), two factors play an important role in determining the sample size, namely the alpha level and the acceptable level or error. Kotrlik and Higgins (2001) summarized several ways of calculating the required sample size, where equation \\(\\ref{eq-sample1}\\) and \\(\\ref{eq-sample2}\\) excerpted the calculation for continuous variable.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn_0 &= \\frac{t^2 \\cdot s^2}{d^2} \\label{eq-sample1} \\\\\nn   &= \\frac{n_0}{1 + \\frac{n_0}{N}} \\label{eq-sample2}\n\\end{align}\\]\nDenoted in Equation \\(\\ref{eq-sample1}\\), \\(n\\) is the estimated minimum number of samples; \\(t\\) is the value acquired from T distribution, where \\(t\\) = 1.96 when \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05; \\(s\\) is the estimated standard deviation of responses in the population; \\(d\\) is the acceptable margin of error mean estimation. Computing \\(s\\) requires dividing the number of inclusive scale in a questionnaire response by 6, the total number of deviation in a normal distribution. In case we are using a 7-point scale, the value of \\(s\\) would be \\(\\frac{7}{6}\\) = 1.167. Lastly, the acceptable margin of error for mean estimation \\(d\\) is the product of points on scale and the acceptable margin of error, conveniently set as 7 \\(\\cdot\\) 0.3 = 0.21. Equation \\(\\ref{eq-sample2}\\) is rather straightforward, where the newly introduced variable is \\(N\\) = 10,562,088, representing the total number of population in Jakarta. Plugging in all the numbers into equation resulted in Equation \\(\\ref{eq-sample3}\\), where the minimum number of samples should be 119.\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn_0 &= \\frac{1.96^2 \\cdot 1.167^2}{0.21^2} \\label{eq-sample3} \\\\\n    &= 118.64 \\notag \\\\\n    &\\approx 119 \\notag \\\\\nn   &= \\frac{119}{1 + \\frac{119}{10,562,088}} \\notag \\\\\n    &= 118.99 \\notag \\\\\n    &\\approx 119 \\notag\n\\end{align}\\]\nOn the other hand, sample size is also estimable by following equation \\(\\ref{eq-sample4}\\). In this equation, \\(p\\) represents the proportion of an event; \\(z\\) is a Z distribution corresponding to the \\(\\alpha\\) value; \\(E\\) is the expected maximum error, which is conveniently agreed to 3%. Following this formula, it is possible to integrate disease prevalence as a proportion \\(p\\) when calculating the required sample size. According to GBD 2019 Mental Disorders Collaborators (2022), the global prevalence of depression and anxiety in 2019 was 3,440 and 3,779 per 100,000 people, respectively. Thus, the proportion for depression \\(p_D\\) and anxiety \\(p_A\\) are 0.034 and 0.038. By choosing the highest proportion, we can estimate the required sample size as indicated in Equation \\(\\ref{eq-sample5}\\).\n\\[\\begin{align}\nn &= \\frac{p \\cdot (1 - p) \\cdot z^2}{E^2} \\label{eq-sample4} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{0.062 \\cdot (1 - 0.062) \\cdot 1.96^2}{0.03^2} \\label{eq-sample5} \\\\\n  &\\approx 250 \\notag\n\\end{align}\\]\nHaving two sample size estimations, i.e. 119 and 250, the higher number of minimum sample is preferred. Initially, a pilot study according to Cohen (2013) will be commenced to acquire 250 individuals from the general population. Then, the required sample size is recalculated with Monte-Carlo simulation using the pilot data (Green and MacLeod 2016).",

    "text": "Data Collection\nThe questionnaire used in the survey is adapted from the WMH study, which employs CIDI to diagnose mental heath issues (Kessler et al. 2012). Correspondingly, this survey takes some parts of CIDI and items used in the National Comorbidity Survey to ensure that depression and anxiety closely resemble the clinical diagnostic criteria. The rationale behind collecting these data is to enable stratification based on age and sex, also calibration using depression prevalence; both are further detailed under section 1.6. The data collected through a large-scale survey are as follow:\n\nScreening data:1\n\nAge\nSex\nDomicile\nMarital status\nSleeping issue frequency\nNervousness frequency\nHeadache frequency\nNumber of days affected by health condition\n\nEmployment and financial status:2\n\nCurrent employment status\nYears spent working\nIndustrial sector\nJob levels in the workplace\nRange of monthly income\nRange of monthly expenses\n\nCause of worries:3\n\nEconomic and material\nChildren\nMarriage\nOther interpersonal issues\nJob\nPersonal health\nFamily’s health\nIndependence\nPersonal characteristics\nCommunity, national, or world problems\n\nDepression diagnostic criteria4\nAnxiety diagnostic criteria5\nMaslach’s burnout inventory\n\n1 https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20Screener.pdf2 https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20Employment.pdf3 https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20Worries%20and%20Unhappiness.pdf4 https://pdf.medenshealth.com/MINI-Standard.pdf5 https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir/replication/US%20GAD.pdfA large-scale survey will be conducted online following a convenience sampling procedure. The link to access the online survey will be advertised to reach the targeted population in Jakarta, West Java, and East Java. As a part of non-probability sampling, convenience sampling is favored due to its simplicity and applicability. Although using a probability sampling method is desirable, the absence of an institutionally accessible internet panel for research purposes in Indonesia renders using probability sampling in an online survey impractical. Therefore, we establish a pseudo-panel comprised of multiple groups of heterogeneous sub-populations by adopting convenience sampling procedure. To indirectly compare the survey respondents with the general population, we match respondents’ demography data to the basic health research (riset kesehatan dasar/Riskesdas), which will allow generalizing specific sub-populations to a certain degree. A list of pseudo-panelists is selected through clustered random sampling by adjusting representativeness using population age group. The disadvantage of this approach is the inability to pre-allocate respondents into clusters, which is only possible by conducting an interim analysis during data collection.\nQualitative data will be collected through focus group discussion and semi-structured in-depth interview. Focus group discussion is intended to collect opinions from four groups, representing male and female respondents aged younger and older than 35 years old. Each focus group has 8-12 participants who will engage in a discussion led by a moderator. Meanwhile, semi-structured in-depth interview is intended to collect perspective from key-opinion leaders, including the chairman of the Indonesian Doctor Association (Ikatan Dokter Indonesia/IDI), the chairman of the Indonesian Psychological Association (Himpunan Psikologi Indonesia/HIMPSI), the chairman of the Indonesian Psychiatric Association (Perhimpunan Dokter Spesialis Kesehatan Jiwa Indonesia/PDSKJI), and the Directorate General of Public Health from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia.",

    "text": "Data Processing\nThe acquired tabular data will be first standardized and coded as a flat text file to support an extensive compatibility with other software. The codebook of the dataset will be available as a JSON file, and serve the purpose as the complete metadata. Summarized metadata and short documentation are available as commented lines in the flat file. The complete documentation of an end-to-end data-analysis procedures are stored as an analytic pipeline in a make-like R script with a reproducibility instruction in a README file. All user-defined functions are adequately commented as a docstring and stored in a public repository to ensure transparency.\nFirst, the data is cleaned based on completion also inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data is regarded incomplete in case of missing values, which might happen (not) at random. After checking for completion and criteria, the data is standardized based on the variables, i.e. to set a correct object type for each field. For nominal variables, the class level is defined and recorded in the metadata. For ordinal variables, the data is ordered according to its natural order. All numeric variables are treated as a float, except for time-stamp field which will be treated as a POSIX date time. Other fields are treated as a string with no particular level or order. Entry with missing values in the psychological outcome variables are discarded. All entries are grouped based on age in a 10-year interval, reflecting sub-group analysis of major depressive disorder prevalence reported in Riskesdas 2018.\nSecond, psychological outcomes as a dependent variable (DV) are scored. The initial scoring for all psychological outcomes are solely intended for completing the missing-value analysis. Scoring are done by summing the dimensional/factor component of an instrument, as recommended by its manual. No calculation of true score or weight-adjusted score is considered for the initial scoring. The obtained initial score will be labeled as a raw score, which provide a rough estimate of the true underlying latent score.\nThird, missing data is labelled row-wise as a new variable and further analyzed. To determine the mechanism of missingness, the variable signifying missing entry is cross-tabulated with each DV and tested for statistical significance using a \\(\\chi^2\\) test. To reduce the family-wise error rate when detecting non-random missing value generating process, Bonferroni correction is applied to the acquired p-values. If missingness happened at random, simple imputation method with central value would suffice. On the other hand, if missingness happened not at random, multiple imputation with chained equation will be performed to fill in the missing entry.\nFourth, the true score of psychological outcomes is estimated by calculating the plausible values from the factor scores. To obtain the factor score, the items from each psychometric instrument is fitted to create latent-variable models. These model are tested for its goodness of fit by evaluating the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Random Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative-Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), and Standardized Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMR). For a fit model, an asymptotic sampling covariance matrix is extracted from the estimated factor scores. Using 1,000 iterations, a set of values is drawn from the sampling distribution of the factor scores; the mean of drawn values are regarded as the true score.\nFifth, a sampling procedure is applied to the cleaned dataset, with the intention of preserving a realistic proportion of people affected by major depressive disorder. An online survey following convenient sampling technique is likely to suffer from participation bias, where the obtained response may not completely reflect the general population. The primary objective of this research is to assess the state resilience, hypothesized as the residuals obtained from a linear model of stressors in predicting psychological outcomes. As such, it is important to adjust the ratio of psychological outcomes to the estimated prevalence in the population. For this purpose, reports from Riskesdas in 2018 is used, where the prevalence of depression in each age groups is used as a standard reference. To perform sampling from the acquired responses, a random set of responses is drawn from the response pool while keeping the ratio of depressed-to-non-depressed subjects. The number of samples being drawn satisfies the minimum required samples in each sub-group, and the ratio of each sub-group is adjusted based on population census data. This sampling procedure is repeated with replacement for 1,000 times, and state resilience is calculated independently in each iteration.\nSixth, for each sampled subset, the score of state resilience is calculated following a recommendation by Höltge and Ungar (2022). Principal component analysis (PCA) is performed independently to a set of independent variables (IV) and DV. In this case, IV comprises general stressors and health-related stressors; while DV comprises the true scores obtained from psychometric instruments. From these two PCA models, the first principal components (\\(PC\\)) of IV and DV are subsequently extracted. \\(PC_{IV}\\) is then fitted to linear model to predict the \\(PC_{DV}\\), where residuals of the model will be extracted. Using residual approach to measure resilience can be misleading in case of outliers, which may skew the model and produce biased residuals. To improve model robustness, two additional steps are implemented: (1) calculate the Cook’s distance of the extracted residuals, then remove the identified outliers; and (2) use a robust correlation matrix when refitting the PCA model after removing outliers. State resilience is represented as the obtained residual, where the mean of resilience score is calculated per entry and imputed back to the original dataset.",

Qualitative findings from focus group discussion and interview will be included to enrich the discussion.\n\nUnivariate Data Analysis\nUnivariate analysis is conducted to describe the distribution of the variable. For all continuous variables, the value of mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile range are calculated. For all continuous variables, the frequency and its percentage are presented.\n\n\nBivariate Data Analysis\nBivariate analysis will be conducted for a set of continuous variable with one grouping categorical variable. For each set, a pair plot will be generated to present an overview of covariance matrix, distribution plot, and median value, all grouped by the categorical variable. The categorical variables that will be considered in this analysis are age group, sex (male/female), domicile (Jakarta/West Java/East Java), and marital status (not married/married). The continuous variables are true scores of the psychological outcomes (depression, anxiety, burnout), summary of the frequency of issues from the screening data, sum of cause of worries, and state resilience. To simplify the exploratory procedure, the presence of psychological disorders will be denoted in a new variable, which only contain TRUE and FALSE. Test of proportional difference and mean difference is conducted for categorical and continuous variables after each variable is grouped by the presence any psychological disorder.\n\n\nMultivariable Data Analysis\nA structural equation model is used to evaluate the moderating effect of state resilience for the emergence of psychological outcomes in presence of stressors. Stressors, as an independent variable, has a direct association with psychological outcomes, as the dependent variables.

    "text": "Negative emotions and adversities are expected to be encountered in our daily lives, though some people seem to navigate through adversities better than others. Similar to physical immunity, our mental space also has its protective mechanism, i.e., resilience. Though there is no consensus clarifying the definition of resilience, Vella, Pai, et al. (2019) suggested that resilience constitutes the occurrence of adversity and its mitigation in promoting positive outcomes. Following the process-based definition, it is debatable whether a resilient individual relies on their innate psychological trait or adaptive state when facing risks. Nonetheless, adversity becomes the hallmark of being resilient as a trait and a state. Pragmatically, both trait and state of resilience have a particular degree of contribution to promoting individual well-being. On the other hand, looking at the outcome-based definition, resilience is the bridge between risk or adversity and positive individual experience, advancing the emotive dynamics and the propensity towards positive outcomes. Thus, it is essential to initially define the boundary of adversity and positive outcomes before conceptualizing resilience.\n\n\nThe first part of investigating resilience is defining adversity, an interconnecting facade between external risk factors and internal subjective experience. Quantifying adversity requires an association between adverse life events and individual adjustment. A statistical magnitude exists for measuring negative circumstances and their relation to emotional saliency; however, adversity could also be denoted without referencing the statistical threshold. As such, adversity can be evaluated as the presence or absence of suffering in relation to difficulty, implying adversity is a general setback being encountered on a daily basis (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019).\nThe second part of evaluating resilience is setting a boundary to what a positive outcome means. As a generic reference, a positive outcome implies an adaptive momentum that allows individuals to recover from a negative setback. When challenged by risk or adversity in life, a positive outcome is plausibly explained as the capability to prevent mental illness (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019). The presence of adaptive momentum as a positive outcome enables an individual to maintain, regain, or surpass their functional state upon exposure to a negative setback. Having a broader perspective on adversity and positive outcomes poses particular merits, including leveraging the limitation of life-event quantification and avoiding too rigid of a formal definition, which potentially hinders looking at the blue-sky picture: resilience.\nDelving into the definition of adversity and positive outcomes, we understand that resilience is paramount to adapting against negative setbacks in life. Bonanno (2008) reviewed several aspects of resilience and highlighted the difference between resilience and recovery. The connotation implied in recovery is the presence of pathological symptoms within one period of time, which gradually dissipates. Meanwhile, resilience describes the mental capacity to maintain the equilibrium of well-being in the face of adversity. Denoting that resilience is different from the absence of psychological issues, Bonanno (2008) further speculated that resilient subjects might have perturbation in daily functioning without succumbing to a disorder. Perturbations may vary from one person to another; to name but a few, the perturbation can manifest as sporadic preoccupations, restless sleep, nervousness due to certain stimuli, and sadness. However, Infurna and Luthar (2016) argued that resilience could also be observed in individuals recovering from psychological disorders, implying that resilience is not only a trait but also a necessary auxiliary functioning state to expedite the recovery. Bonanno (2008) also Infurna and Luthar (2016) brought into the table a continuum progression of how a resilient trait can intertwine with the recovery process, where a resilient state connects both ends of the spectrum. In their critical appraisal, Luthar, Cicchetti, and Becker (2000) emphasized the importance of drawing a boundary in defining resilience as a trait or state, where they proposed the state of being resilient as “a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity.” In easing the definitional burden, figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical remarks of how resilience as a trait and state contributes to recovering from negative setbacks in life. Resilience as a trait defines the scope of how a personality trait plays the role of a threshold against adversity in determining psychological outcomes. On the other hand, resilience as a state is akin to a buffer leveraging negative impacts by promoting the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Theoretical conceptualization on how resilience affects the well-being trajectory over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRutten et al. (2013) argued that swift recovery from negative setbacks in life relies on three emerging psychological factors, namely secure attachment, positive emotions, and purpose of life. These psychological factors are the core domains enhancing general mental health, preventing disturbance of well-being upon exposure to adversity, and improving the overall recovery process. Throughout their psychological development phases, children derive their attachment to the caregiver as an internal working model. Such a working model is important to integrate external stimuli into internal perception, especially in understanding social relationships. Infant-parent attachment influences the emergence of an internal working model during the first year of life, which continues to evolve and then consolidate at the age of five (Rutten et al. 2013). Secure attachment perceived by children is internally represented as a mental image of ideal interpersonal relationships. Children with a secure attachment will perceive themselves as worthy, others as reliable, and the environment as challenging but manageable. Children with secured attachment are more inclined towards having effective self-regulation, the ability to understand their own and other’s emotions, and the capacity to manage interpersonal relationships (Atwool 2006).\nPositive emotion extensively supports psychological well-being, whereas the increase in positive emotion outweighs the decrease in negative emotion in promoting mental health. Positive emotion is the required element to learn the ability to trust and display compassion (Rutten et al. 2013). Similar to its impact on general health, positive emotion is essential in recovering mental well-being. Positive emotions, even if they only occur temporarily, have a lasting impact in bridging resilient traits to improving life satisfaction (Cohn et al. 2009). On the other hand, negative emotions do not substantially alter the benefit of positive emotions (Cohn et al. 2009) nor the expected positive behavior over time (Nylocks et al. 2018). Inversely, the presence of positive emotion mediates emotion regulation against negative emotion (Waugh 2020). Furthermore, experiencing positive emotions has the merit of buffering the perceived adversity, where Waugh and Koster (2015) instigated elevated positive emotion as a strong determinant of distress recovery. The inclination towards experiencing positive emotions varies individually, but not to a great degree after controlling for social and interpersonal stressors. Rutten et al. (2013) surmised that positive emotion is rather well defined when taking into account person-specific environment and societal influence in explaining the subjective perception of positive stimuli. Culminating positive emotion is essential in aiding the coping process, which both, in turn, shall be reflected as a state of resilience (Tugade and Fredrickson 2006).\nMoving beyond secure attachment and positive emotion, having a purpose in life offers a lasting positive impact compared to a fleeting pleasure (Rutten et al. 2013). A purpose in life leads to an eudaimonic pursuit of meaning and personal values. In the pursuit of meaning, eudaimonic motives reflect an individual approach focusing on the realization and flourishing of the perceived innate potential (Kaczmarek 2017). An overarching level of experience sustained by pursuing the purpose of life promotes well-being by improving optimism and reducing the risk of depression and loneliness (Kim et al. 2021). When sensing the values and purpose in life, Rutten et al. (2013) suggested that religion and spirituality have a crucial part in their interplay in conferring resilience. Even though social interaction is the key element supporting well-being through a hedonic pursuit, religion becomes a supporting pillar of well-being for eudaimonic pursuit in a socially disconnected population (Chan, Michalak, and Ybarra 2018). Though it is arguable that both hedonic and eudaimonic motives have an overlap of pragmatic influences on realizing purposes in life (Disabato et al. 2016), it is conclusive that the meaning of life is particularly personal and bears a solitary burden. In lieu of dwelling on impractical behavioral conquest, such as promoting the pursuit of meaning, moderating the social environment is similarly beneficial to reconstructing the grand schema of self and the world, which shapes the positive emotional experience and sense of goal (Rutten et al. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Seven pillars of a resilient state, as adapted from Precious and Lindsay (2019) also Rutten et al. (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering resilience as a fluid psychological state, several factors contribute to the dynamic of the human psyche. Precious and Lindsay (2019) proposed seven main pillars supporting resilience, which we can derive from three psychological factors introduced by Rutten et al. (2013). In figure 2, I deliberately annotated five pillars as a result of secured attachment, while the other two reflect positive emotion and purpose of life, respectively.\nFirst, it is well demonstrated that a secure attachment between children and parental figures correlates positively with prosocial behavior (Gilliom et al. 2002; Viddal et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2020), mediated by the mental capacity to perform self-regulatory function (Heylen et al. 2016). Effortful control explains the degree of self-regulatory capacity to adequately respond to external and internal demands. Effortful control is a volitional capacity to generate an adaptive subdominant response, denoted as temperament regulation in children; this is closely related to emotion regulation, which we will get into later. The presence of effortful control determines temperament stability in children with the tendency to externalize problems (Stifter, Putnam, and Jahromi 2008), where aggression, delinquency, and hyperactivity are their dominant responses (J. Liu 2004). Children with secure attachments are more likely to exert effortful control and develop more amicable subdominant responses to override the dominant ones. Although Gilliom et al. (2002) only reported the association of secure attachment with self-regulatory strategy in boys and Viddal et al. (2015) further supported this clause by demonstrating a positive correlation between secure attachment and self-control moderated by gender, Shi et al. (2020) showed that in the adult population, the effect of gender in self-control is much less pronounced. It implies that the consolidation of self-control (Heylen et al. 2016) supported by a secure attachment produces similar results in both men and women. Using longitudinal data with two time points, Nair et al. (2020) found that effortful control in early adolescents correlates with their resilience at each time point but not across time points. This reflects the dynamics of both resilience and effortful control, both of which can change and consolidate over time. A similar finding was also reported by Eisenberg et al. (2009), indicating effortful control as a mediator bridging secure attachment and resilience.\nSecond, emotion regulation is an integrative part of developing a dynamic, resilient state. Previously, we have elaborated on how temperament regulation comes forth as a derivative of child-parent attachment, which in later life shall influence the emergence of a resilient state. Emotion regulation is a more specialized development enveloping both temperament and attachment as intrinsic and extrinsic factors, accordingly (Cassidy 1994). In the bonding between child and parents, children create an internal projection of the ideal world as their expected working models. These expectations reflect the child-parent interaction, starting from the first year of life and maturing over time. Children with secure attachment are more inclined to model after a responsive emotive signal, where they acknowledge that the parental figures and those around them will reciprocate with their emotional cues. However, children with insecure attachment expect that their immediate surroundings will only selectively attend to their emotions (Bowlby 1973; Hinde and Lorenz 1996; Bretherton 2013). The failure to provide adequate emotional responses will lead children into two major categories of attachment style, namely avoidant and anxious styles, expressing a polarized spectrum of emotion recall and processing. People with an avoidant attachment style lean towards avoiding emotional attachment, presenting with a dull recall of negative memories due to their inherent habit of suppressing thoughts and emotions. On the other pole of the spectrum, people with anxious attachment styles are more likely to recall a vivid negative memory. Both avoidant and anxious types exhibit poor and fragile emotion regulation strategies, exemplified by their reduced capacity to handle severely distressing and uncontrollable chronic events (Mikulincer and Shaver 2019). Meanwhile, children whose parental figures adequately respond to their emotional cues are more open to discussing their negative feelings, which in turn helps them develop a more robust emotion-regulation strategy (Waters et al. 2009). Through attentional control and cognitive reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy can reduce negative emotional responses and, therefore, promote resilience (Kay 2016).\nThird, the coping mechanism allows mental tempering through exposure to daily stress. The formulation of a resilient state is not merely determined by positive encouragement from intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also by experiencing eustress resulting from daily stressors (DiCorcia and Tronick 2011). The presence of a healthy amount of daily stressors shall push an individual to cope and survive, thus allowing for the development of their regulatory capacity. DiCorcia and Tronick (2011) illustrated improving a resilient state in a similar fashion to preparing for a marathon; we push ourselves to our limit, and eventually, we shall break through the shackles. In a more specific context, exposure to eustress allows an individual to develop a coping mechanism to overcome the stressor. When looking at the continuum space of concluding perceptible negative emotion, there are two opposite polars of reconciliation and catharsis: one to diminish and the other to extinguish. Ong et al. (2006) argued that the presence of positive emotions reconciles negative emotions in eliciting resilience against adversity by utilizing mature coping mechanisms. Crane et al. (2018) further supported the argument by demonstrating three capacities required to foster resilience through an adaptive self-reflection, including coping resources, usage of emotional regulatory repertoires, and belief system on resilience itself. Practicing adaptive self-reflection necessitates five consecutive steps, starting from having an emotional awareness, identifying triggers, re-appraising the stressors, evaluating the response, and focusing on the future. The first three steps focus highly on the current situation, while the latter two focus on the developmental aspect. Having an emotional awareness implies being conscious of changes in response to triggering events. Identifying triggers is a discriminating process to understand the causal relationship between events and responses. Re-appraising the stressor is a learning phase utilizing emotional awareness and the ability to identify the trigger as the inputs, where an individual can generate a more suitable response by referring to the desired goal. Then, the response was evaluated as an emotionally detached re-experience of the overall situation, i.e., an exploration of how to improve the response efficacy. Lastly, focusing on the future emphasizes what can be done better in the future in case of similar triggering events (Goodvin et al. 2008; Hamarta, Deniz, and Saltali 2009). The learning phase and maturation of coping mechanisms upon exposure to daily stressors help an individual overcome adversities (Tronick and DiCorcia 2015).\nFourth, self-efficacy is a result of working-model formation during early infant life propelled by a secure attachment to the parental figures (Bender and Ingram 2018). Self-efficacy is a perception of the personal capability to obtain the desired goals, directed by self-referent expectancy and self-reflective thoughts (Bandura 1978). Self-efficacy is attributable to a particular task, where an individual may possess different self-efficacies for different tasks. Perceiving high self-efficacy helps one to bounce back after failures and maintain the operating effort, supporting an individual to sustain their performance under pressure (Heslin and Klehe 2006). People with high self-efficiency are more ready to receive negative feedback and strive to improve their capabilities. Meanwhile, people with low self-efficiency are more prone to be depressed or anxious when receiving negative feedback due to their assumption of incapacity and incompetence. In a previous mediation analysis, Bender and Ingram (2018) demonstrated that both self-efficacy and self-care are partial mediators connecting attachment style with resilience. Individuals with secure attachment styles lean towards developing a positive attitude, strengthening their beliefs on self-capacity. A firm belief in oneself is essential to generate higher efficacy in managing individual and social environments, resulting in resilient attitudes and behaviors. Slightly quoting from Bandura and Watts (1996), belief and disbelief in one’s capacity generate behavioral validation, implying a reciprocation between self-efficacy and the resulting behavior. Self-efficacy belief is a requisite to fuel affective, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms in difficult situations, which in turn promote resilience (Schwarzer and Warner 2012).\nFifth, social support is closely related to social competencies stemming from child-parent attachment; a positive working model on social environment creates a stronger belief in supporting resilience. The presence and absence of parental figures determine the development of the working model in a child, where a secure attachment fosters a belief in social support as a positive working model. Meanwhile, insecure attachment causes fear of intimacy and a tendency to avoid social connection as a negative working model. The perceived working models are crucial in the maturation of social competency, which Mallinckrodt and Wei (2005) summarized as the required skills to develop and maintain supportive social relationships. Two building blocks of social competencies are social self-efficacy and emotional awareness, i.e., the perception of being capable of forming new connections from initial acquaintances and the capability of discerning one’s own and others’ emotions. Individuals with a positive working model tend to demonstrate better social competencies, whereas individuals with a negative working model are lacking in either one of the social competencies. People with an anxious-type attachment style suffer from a higher degree of social uncertainty, denoted by the perception of powerlessness and the inability to develop and maintain close relationships. On the other hand, people with avoidance-type attachment styles actively repress their conscious perception of emotion, displaying a higher degree of affective disinterest (Mallinckrodt and Wei 2005). Maintaining social connection is paramount to the accessibility of psychological and material resources provided by the social network, benefiting an individual’s capacity to handle adversities (Cohen 2004). In their commentary, Sippel et al. (2015) argued that social support is a necessary factor to moderate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities, which aid an individual to display state resilience. The availability of social supports can nurture stress-regulating behavior, including but not limited to improving self-confidence, preventing risky behavior, fostering mature coping mechanisms, and promoting emotion-regulation strategy.\n\n\n\nResilience, both as a trait and state, contributes to maintaining psychological well-being by reducing or buffering the negative effects of experiencing adversities. Hu, Zhang, and Wang (2015) argued that resilience would be best observed as a psychological trait due to its innate and stable nature. Based on resilience traits, it is possible to classify people into groups. However, observing resilience only as a trait will subsequently underestimate the actual occurrence of resilience in the population, where Gheshlagh et al. (2017) demonstrated in their meta-analysis that resilience as measured with CD-RISC1, RSA2, ERS3; their findings presented with high heterogeneity, which indirectly implied difference in instrumental measurements of resilience. On a further note, Gheshlagh et al. (2017) and Hu et al. (2015) suggested that the level of resilience positively correlates with reduced depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Research focus on either type of resilience would be a matter of practicality, i.e., researching resilient traits is better intended for grouping the population based on their level of resilience so that clinicians can prevent mental health issues in people with low resilience (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). On the other hand, focusing on a resilient state would allow the establishment of a mental health policy that can provide support to improve the resilient state. In this investigation, the author is interested in evaluating resilience as a state and its relation to adversity, medication uses, mental health policy, and psychological outcomes.\n1 Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, containing 25 items addressing factors contributing to resilient state2 Resilience Scale for Adults; containing 33 items addressing self-sufficiency, family coherence, and social support3 Essential Resilience Scale; 15 items mostly measuring resilient trait\n\n\n\nResilience is the adaptability of an individual to adversities in routine or occasional circumstances, factoring the biopsychosocial-ecological system supporting multiple promotive and protective factors and processes (Ungar and Theron 2020). Resilient individuals have three essential psychological characteristics, including secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions, and having a purpose in life (Rutten et al. 2013). Resilience is a dynamic process regulating the homeostatic plasticity (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019; H. Liu et al. 2018), which reflects a desirable mental control, emotion regulation, coping mechanism, self-efficacy, a sense of purpose, positive affect, and social support (Precious and Lindsay 2019). Resilient individuals are more likely to bounce back from negative events, either by promptly adapting or quickly recovering, to accomplish a more favorable mental health outcome (Ungar and Theron 2020).\nIndividuals with resilient traits have an overall better mental health, indicated by higher life satisfaction and positive affect. Accordingly, the lack of resilient traits also contributes to heightening depression, anxiety, and negative affect (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). Several studies have also replicated the extensive impact of resilience in lowering depression (Nakazawa et al. 2018), anxiety (Ran et al. 2020; Schiele and Domschke 2018), and burnout (West et al. 2020; Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020). Intriguingly, burnout has been established as a common association between depression and anxiety (Meier and Kim 2022; Koutsimani, Montgomery, and Georganta 2019), suggesting a generic yet distinctive process in relation to mental resilience (Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020; Serrao et al. 2021). In situation-specific distress, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with higher resilience can adapt better to the abrupt changes, reflected by lower trepidation, reduced anxiety, and attenuated depression (Barzilay et al. 2020). In Indonesia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multitude of mental health issues, especially during the large-scale containment, which halted economic activities, mostly impacting those in the mid-low socioeconomic stratum, and hindered social activities, resulting in loneliness and, in some cases, social dejection (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). The pandemic aggravates the mental health situation in Indonesia, where previously, among older adults, 46.28% experienced stress, and 31.72% felt depressed (Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Although the government of Indonesia implemented The Mental Health Act in 2014, the resources and facilities are not widely available (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021; Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Several online mental health services have been spurred during the pandemic, but further regulation and mitigation from the government are necessary to abate the spread of mental health problems (Ifdil et al. 2020), i.e., by establishing a government-verified digital counseling platform, multi-stakeholder mental health support program, and improving the accessibility of mental health services in the primary health care(Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). Considering the intricacies between policy-driven action, resilience, situational changes, depression, anxiety, and burnout, the upcoming investigations will be mainly concerned with unraveling the question:\n\n“What is the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of public health policies to maintain mental resilience amidst adversities, especially regarding their impact on depression, anxiety, burnout, and related medication use?”\n\n\n\n\n\nAtwool, Nicola. 2006. “Attachment and Resilience: Implications for Children in Care.” Child Care in Practice 12 (4): 315–30.\n\n\nBandura, Albert. 1978. “Reflections on Self-Efficacy.” Advances in Behaviour Research and Therapy 1 (4): 237–69.\n\n\nBandura, Albert, and Richard E.

    "text": "Negative emotions and adversities are expected to be encountered in our daily lives, though some people seem to navigate through adversities better than others. Similar to physical immunity, our mental space also has its protective mechanism, i.e., resilience. Though there is no consensus clarifying the definition of resilience, Vella, Pai, et al. (2019) suggested that resilience constitutes the occurrence of adversity and its mitigation in promoting positive outcomes. Following the process-based definition, it is debatable whether a resilient individual relies on their innate psychological trait or adaptive state when facing risks. Nonetheless, adversity becomes the hallmark of being resilient as a trait and a state. Pragmatically, both trait and state of resilience have a particular degree of contribution to promoting individual well-being. On the other hand, looking at the outcome-based definition, resilience is the bridge between risk or adversity and positive individual experience, advancing the emotive dynamics and the propensity towards positive outcomes. Thus, it is essential to initially define the boundary of adversity and positive outcomes before conceptualizing resilience.\n\n\nThe first part of investigating resilience is defining adversity, an interconnecting facade between external risk factors and internal subjective experience. Quantifying adversity requires an association between adverse life events and individual adjustment. A statistical magnitude exists for measuring negative circumstances and their relation to emotional saliency; however, adversity could also be denoted without referencing the statistical threshold. As such, adversity can be evaluated as the presence or absence of suffering in relation to difficulty, implying adversity is a general setback being encountered on a daily basis (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019).\nThe second part of evaluating resilience is setting a boundary to what a positive outcome means. As a generic reference, a positive outcome implies an adaptive momentum that allows individuals to recover from a negative setback. When challenged by risk or adversity in life, a positive outcome is plausibly explained as the capability to prevent mental illness (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019). The presence of adaptive momentum as a positive outcome enables an individual to maintain, regain, or surpass their functional state upon exposure to a negative setback. Having a broader perspective on adversity and positive outcomes poses particular merits, including leveraging the limitation of life-event quantification and avoiding too rigid of a formal definition, which potentially hinders looking at the blue-sky picture: resilience.\nDelving into the definition of adversity and positive outcomes, we understand that resilience is paramount to adapting against negative setbacks in life. Bonanno (2008) reviewed several aspects of resilience and highlighted the difference between resilience and recovery. The connotation implied in recovery is the presence of pathological symptoms within one period of time, which gradually dissipates. Meanwhile, resilience describes the mental capacity to maintain the equilibrium of well-being in the face of adversity. Denoting that resilience is different from the absence of psychological issues, Bonanno (2008) further speculated that resilient subjects might have perturbation in daily functioning without succumbing to a disorder. Perturbations may vary from one person to another; to name but a few, the perturbation can manifest as sporadic preoccupations, restless sleep, nervousness due to certain stimuli, and sadness. However, Infurna and Luthar (2016) argued that resilience could also be observed in individuals recovering from psychological disorders, implying that resilience is not only a trait but also a necessary auxiliary functioning state to expedite the recovery. Bonanno (2008) also Infurna and Luthar (2016) brought into the table a continuum progression of how a resilient trait can intertwine with the recovery process, where a resilient state connects both ends of the spectrum. In their critical appraisal, Luthar, Cicchetti, and Becker (2000) emphasized the importance of drawing a boundary in defining resilience as a trait or state, where they proposed the state of being resilient as “a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity.” In easing the definitional burden, figure 1 illustrates the hypothetical remarks of how resilience as a trait and state contributes to recovering from negative setbacks in life. Resilience as a trait defines the scope of how a personality trait plays the role of a threshold against adversity in determining psychological outcomes. On the other hand, resilience as a state is akin to a buffer leveraging negative impacts by promoting the recovery process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Theoretical conceptualization on how resilience affects the well-being trajectory over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRutten et al. (2013) argued that swift recovery from negative setbacks in life relies on three emerging psychological factors, namely secure attachment, positive emotions, and purpose of life. These psychological factors are the core domains enhancing general mental health, preventing disturbance of well-being upon exposure to adversity, and improving the overall recovery process. Throughout their psychological development phases, children derive their attachment to the caregiver as an internal working model. Such a working model is important to integrate external stimuli into internal perception, especially in understanding social relationships. Infant-parent attachment influences the emergence of an internal working model during the first year of life, which continues to evolve and then consolidate at the age of five (Rutten et al. 2013). Secure attachment perceived by children is internally represented as a mental image of ideal interpersonal relationships. Children with a secure attachment will perceive themselves as worthy, others as reliable, and the environment as challenging but manageable. Children with secured attachment are more inclined towards having effective self-regulation, the ability to understand their own and other’s emotions, and the capacity to manage interpersonal relationships (Atwool 2006).\nPositive emotion extensively supports psychological well-being, whereas the increase in positive emotion outweighs the decrease in negative emotion in promoting mental health. Positive emotion is the required element to learn the ability to trust and display compassion (Rutten et al. 2013). Similar to its impact on general health, positive emotion is essential in recovering mental well-being. Positive emotions, even if they only occur temporarily, have a lasting impact in bridging resilient traits to improving life satisfaction (Cohn et al. 2009). On the other hand, negative emotions do not substantially alter the benefit of positive emotions (Cohn et al. 2009) nor the expected positive behavior over time (Nylocks et al. 2018). Inversely, the presence of positive emotion mediates emotion regulation against negative emotion (Waugh 2020). Furthermore, experiencing positive emotions has the merit of buffering the perceived adversity, where Waugh and Koster (2015) instigated elevated positive emotion as a strong determinant of distress recovery. The inclination towards experiencing positive emotions varies individually, but not to a great degree after controlling for social and interpersonal stressors. Rutten et al. (2013) surmised that positive emotion is rather well defined when taking into account person-specific environment and societal influence in explaining the subjective perception of positive stimuli. Culminating positive emotion is essential in aiding the coping process, which both, in turn, shall be reflected as a state of resilience (Tugade and Fredrickson 2006).\nMoving beyond secure attachment and positive emotion, having a purpose in life offers a lasting positive impact compared to a fleeting pleasure (Rutten et al. 2013). A purpose in life leads to an eudaimonic pursuit of meaning and personal values. In the pursuit of meaning, eudaimonic motives reflect an individual approach focusing on the realization and flourishing of the perceived innate potential (Kaczmarek 2017). An overarching level of experience sustained by pursuing the purpose of life promotes well-being by improving optimism and reducing the risk of depression and loneliness (Kim et al. 2021). When sensing the values and purpose in life, Rutten et al. (2013) suggested that religion and spirituality have a crucial part in their interplay in conferring resilience. Even though social interaction is the key element supporting well-being through a hedonic pursuit, religion becomes a supporting pillar of well-being for eudaimonic pursuit in a socially disconnected population (Chan, Michalak, and Ybarra 2018). Though it is arguable that both hedonic and eudaimonic motives have an overlap of pragmatic influences on realizing purposes in life (Disabato et al. 2016), it is conclusive that the meaning of life is particularly personal and bears a solitary burden. In lieu of dwelling on impractical behavioral conquest, such as promoting the pursuit of meaning, moderating the social environment is similarly beneficial to reconstructing the grand schema of self and the world, which shapes the positive emotional experience and sense of goal (Rutten et al. 2013).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Seven pillars of a resilient state, as adapted from Precious and Lindsay (2019) also Rutten et al. (2013)\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering resilience as a fluid psychological state, several factors contribute to the dynamic of the human psyche. Precious and Lindsay (2019) proposed seven main pillars supporting resilience, which we can derive from three psychological factors introduced by Rutten et al. (2013). In figure 2, I deliberately annotated five pillars as a result of secured attachment, while the other two reflect positive emotion and purpose of life, respectively.\nFirst, it is well demonstrated that a secure attachment between children and parental figures correlates positively with prosocial behavior (Gilliom et al. 2002; Viddal et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2020), mediated by the mental capacity to perform self-regulatory function (Heylen et al. 2016). Effortful control explains the degree of self-regulatory capacity to adequately respond to external and internal demands. Effortful control is a volitional capacity to generate an adaptive subdominant response, denoted as temperament regulation in children; this is closely related to emotion regulation, which we will get into later. The presence of effortful control determines temperament stability in children with the tendency to externalize problems (Stifter, Putnam, and Jahromi 2008), where aggression, delinquency, and hyperactivity are their dominant responses (J. Liu 2004). Children with secure attachments are more likely to exert effortful control and develop more amicable subdominant responses to override the dominant ones. Although Gilliom et al. (2002) only reported the association of secure attachment with self-regulatory strategy in boys and Viddal et al. (2015) further supported this clause by demonstrating a positive correlation between secure attachment and self-control moderated by gender, Shi et al. (2020) showed that in the adult population, the effect of gender in self-control is much less pronounced. It implies that the consolidation of self-control (Heylen et al. 2016) supported by a secure attachment produces similar results in both men and women. Using longitudinal data with two time points, Nair et al. (2020) found that effortful control in early adolescents correlates with their resilience at each time point but not across time points. This reflects the dynamics of both resilience and effortful control, both of which can change and consolidate over time. A similar finding was also reported by Eisenberg et al. (2009), indicating effortful control as a mediator bridging secure attachment and resilience.\nSecond, emotion regulation is an integrative part of developing a dynamic, resilient state. Previously, we have elaborated on how temperament regulation comes forth as a derivative of child-parent attachment, which in later life shall influence the emergence of a resilient state. Emotion regulation is a more specialized development enveloping both temperament and attachment as intrinsic and extrinsic factors, accordingly (Cassidy 1994). In the bonding between child and parents, children create an internal projection of the ideal world as their expected working models. These expectations reflect the child-parent interaction, starting from the first year of life and maturing over time. Children with secure attachment are more inclined to model after a responsive emotive signal, where they acknowledge that the parental figures and those around them will reciprocate with their emotional cues. However, children with insecure attachment expect that their immediate surroundings will only selectively attend to their emotions (Bowlby 1973; Hinde and Lorenz 1996; Bretherton 2013). The failure to provide adequate emotional responses will lead children into two major categories of attachment style, namely avoidant and anxious styles, expressing a polarized spectrum of emotion recall and processing. People with an avoidant attachment style lean towards avoiding emotional attachment, presenting with a dull recall of negative memories due to their inherent habit of suppressing thoughts and emotions. On the other pole of the spectrum, people with anxious attachment styles are more likely to recall a vivid negative memory. Both avoidant and anxious types exhibit poor and fragile emotion regulation strategies, exemplified by their reduced capacity to handle severely distressing and uncontrollable chronic events (Mikulincer and Shaver 2019). Meanwhile, children whose parental figures adequately respond to their emotional cues are more open to discussing their negative feelings, which in turn helps them develop a more robust emotion-regulation strategy (Waters et al. 2009). Through attentional control and cognitive reappraisal, an emotion-regulation strategy can reduce negative emotional responses and, therefore, promote resilience (Kay 2016).\nThird, the coping mechanism allows mental tempering through exposure to daily stress. The formulation of a resilient state is not merely determined by positive encouragement from intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also by experiencing eustress resulting from daily stressors (DiCorcia and Tronick 2011). The presence of a healthy amount of daily stressors shall push an individual to cope and survive, thus allowing for the development of their regulatory capacity. DiCorcia and Tronick (2011) illustrated improving a resilient state in a similar fashion to preparing for a marathon; we push ourselves to our limit, and eventually, we shall break through the shackles. In a more specific context, exposure to eustress allows an individual to develop a coping mechanism to overcome the stressor. When looking at the continuum space of concluding perceptible negative emotion, there are two opposite polars of reconciliation and catharsis: one to diminish and the other to extinguish. Ong et al. (2006) argued that the presence of positive emotions reconciles negative emotions in eliciting resilience against adversity by utilizing mature coping mechanisms. Crane et al. (2018) further supported the argument by demonstrating three capacities required to foster resilience through an adaptive self-reflection, including coping resources, usage of emotional regulatory repertoires, and belief system on resilience itself. Practicing adaptive self-reflection necessitates five consecutive steps, starting from having an emotional awareness, identifying triggers, re-appraising the stressors, evaluating the response, and focusing on the future. The first three steps focus highly on the current situation, while the latter two focus on the developmental aspect. Having an emotional awareness implies being conscious of changes in response to triggering events. Identifying triggers is a discriminating process to understand the causal relationship between events and responses. Re-appraising the stressor is a learning phase utilizing emotional awareness and the ability to identify the trigger as the inputs, where an individual can generate a more suitable response by referring to the desired goal. Then, the response was evaluated as an emotionally detached re-experience of the overall situation, i.e., an exploration of how to improve the response efficacy. Lastly, focusing on the future emphasizes what can be done better in the future in case of similar triggering events (Goodvin et al. 2008; Hamarta, Deniz, and Saltali 2009). The learning phase and maturation of coping mechanisms upon exposure to daily stressors help an individual overcome adversities (Tronick and DiCorcia 2015).\nFourth, self-efficacy is a result of working-model formation during early infant life propelled by a secure attachment to the parental figures (Bender and Ingram 2018). Self-efficacy is a perception of the personal capability to obtain the desired goals, directed by self-referent expectancy and self-reflective thoughts (Bandura 1978). Self-efficacy is attributable to a particular task, where an individual may possess different self-efficacies for different tasks. Perceiving high self-efficacy helps one to bounce back after failures and maintain the operating effort, supporting an individual to sustain their performance under pressure (Heslin and Klehe 2006). People with high self-efficiency are more ready to receive negative feedback and strive to improve their capabilities. Meanwhile, people with low self-efficiency are more prone to be depressed or anxious when receiving negative feedback due to their assumption of incapacity and incompetence. In a previous mediation analysis, Bender and Ingram (2018) demonstrated that both self-efficacy and self-care are partial mediators connecting attachment style with resilience. Individuals with secure attachment styles lean towards developing a positive attitude, strengthening their beliefs on self-capacity. A firm belief in oneself is essential to generate higher efficacy in managing individual and social environments, resulting in resilient attitudes and behaviors. Slightly quoting from Bandura and Watts (1996), belief and disbelief in one’s capacity generate behavioral validation, implying a reciprocation between self-efficacy and the resulting behavior. Self-efficacy belief is a requisite to fuel affective, motivational, and behavioral mechanisms in difficult situations, which in turn promote resilience (Schwarzer and Warner 2012).\nFifth, social support is closely related to social competencies stemming from child-parent attachment; a positive working model on social environment creates a stronger belief in supporting resilience. The presence and absence of parental figures determine the development of the working model in a child, where a secure attachment fosters a belief in social support as a positive working model. Meanwhile, insecure attachment causes fear of intimacy and a tendency to avoid social connection as a negative working model. The perceived working models are crucial in the maturation of social competency, which Mallinckrodt and Wei (2005) summarized as the required skills to develop and maintain supportive social relationships. Two building blocks of social competencies are social self-efficacy and emotional awareness, i.e., the perception of being capable of forming new connections from initial acquaintances and the capability of discerning one’s own and others’ emotions. Individuals with a positive working model tend to demonstrate better social competencies, whereas individuals with a negative working model are lacking in either one of the social competencies. People with an anxious-type attachment style suffer from a higher degree of social uncertainty, denoted by the perception of powerlessness and the inability to develop and maintain close relationships. On the other hand, people with avoidance-type attachment styles actively repress their conscious perception of emotion, displaying a higher degree of affective disinterest (Mallinckrodt and Wei 2005). Maintaining social connection is paramount to the accessibility of psychological and material resources provided by the social network, benefiting an individual’s capacity to handle adversities (Cohen 2004). In their commentary, Sippel et al. (2015) argued that social support is a necessary factor to moderate genetic and environmental vulnerabilities, which aid an individual to display state resilience. The availability of social supports can nurture stress-regulating behavior, including but not limited to improving self-confidence, preventing risky behavior, fostering mature coping mechanisms, and promoting emotion-regulation strategy.\n\n\n\nResilience, both as a trait and state, contributes to maintaining psychological well-being by reducing or buffering the negative effects of experiencing adversities. Hu, Zhang, and Wang (2015) argued that resilience would be best observed as a psychological trait due to its innate and stable nature. Based on resilience traits, it is possible to classify people into groups. However, observing resilience only as a trait will subsequently underestimate the actual occurrence of resilience in the population, where Gheshlagh et al. (2017) demonstrated in their meta-analysis that resilience as measured with CD-RISC1, RSA2, ERS3; their findings presented with high heterogeneity, which indirectly implied difference in instrumental measurements of resilience. On a further note, Gheshlagh et al. (2017) and Hu et al. (2015) suggested that the level of resilience positively correlates with reduced depression, anxiety, and negative affect. Research focus on either type of resilience would be a matter of practicality, i.e., researching resilient traits is better intended for grouping the population based on their level of resilience so that clinicians can prevent mental health issues in people with low resilience (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). On the other hand, focusing on a resilient state would allow the establishment of a mental health policy that can provide support to improve the resilient state. In this investigation, the author is interested in evaluating resilience as a state and its relation to adversity, medication uses, mental health policy, and psychological outcomes.\n1 Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, containing 25 items addressing factors contributing to resilient state2 Resilience Scale for Adults; containing 33 items addressing self-sufficiency, family coherence, and social support3 Essential Resilience Scale; 15 items mostly measuring resilient trait"

    "text": "Resilience is the adaptability of an individual to adversities in routine or occasional circumstances, factoring the biopsychosocial-ecological system supporting multiple promotive and protective factors and processes (Ungar and Theron 2020). Resilient individuals have three essential psychological characteristics, including secure attachment, experiencing positive emotions, and having a purpose in life (Rutten et al. 2013). Resilience is a dynamic process regulating the homeostatic plasticity (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019; H. Liu et al. 2018), which reflects a desirable mental control, emotion regulation, coping mechanism, self-efficacy, a sense of purpose, positive affect, and social support (Precious and Lindsay 2019). Resilient individuals are more likely to bounce back from negative events, either by promptly adapting or quickly recovering, to accomplish a more favorable mental health outcome (Ungar and Theron 2020).\nIndividuals with resilient traits have an overall better mental health, indicated by higher life satisfaction and positive affect. Accordingly, the lack of resilient traits also contributes to heightening depression, anxiety, and negative affect (Hu, Zhang, and Wang 2015). Several studies have also replicated the extensive impact of resilience in lowering depression (Nakazawa et al. 2018), anxiety (Ran et al. 2020; Schiele and Domschke 2018), and burnout (West et al. 2020; Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020). Intriguingly, burnout has been established as a common association between depression and anxiety (Meier and Kim 2022; Koutsimani, Montgomery, and Georganta 2019), suggesting a generic yet distinctive process in relation to mental resilience (Luceno-Moreno et al. 2020; Serrao et al. 2021). In situation-specific distress, e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals with higher resilience can adapt better to the abrupt changes, reflected by lower trepidation, reduced anxiety, and attenuated depression (Barzilay et al. 2020). In Indonesia, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a multitude of mental health issues, especially during the large-scale containment, which halted economic activities, mostly impacting those in the mid-low socioeconomic stratum, and hindered social activities, resulting in loneliness and, in some cases, social dejection (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). The pandemic aggravates the mental health situation in Indonesia, where previously, among older adults, 46.28% experienced stress, and 31.72% felt depressed (Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Although the government of Indonesia implemented The Mental Health Act in 2014, the resources and facilities are not widely available (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021; Hanum, Utoyo, and Jaya 2022). Several online mental health services have been spurred during the pandemic, but further regulation and mitigation from the government are necessary to abate the spread of mental health problems (Ifdil et al. 2020), i.e., by establishing a government-verified digital counseling platform, multi-stakeholder mental health support program, and improving the accessibility of mental health services in the primary health care(Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). Considering the intricacies between policy-driven action, resilience, situational changes, depression, anxiety, and burnout, the upcoming investigations will be mainly concerned with unraveling the question:\n\n“What is the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of public health policies to maintain mental resilience amidst adversities, especially regarding their impact on depression, anxiety, burnout, and related medication use?”\n\n\n\n\n\nAtwool, Nicola. 2006. “Attachment and Resilience: Implications for Children in Care.” Child Care in Practice 12 (4): 315–30.\n\n\nBandura, Albert. 1978. “Reflections on Self-Efficacy.” Advances in Behaviour Research and Therapy 1 (4): 237–69.\n\n\nBandura, Albert, and Richard E.

    "text": "This chapter focuses on elaborating theories and findings pertaining to resilience and psychological outcomes. Section 1.1 elaborates the motivation behind this research, including the economic evaluation of mental disorders. Section 1.2 summarizes child-parent attachments as proposed by Bowlby (1973) and Ainsworth (1979). Section 1.3 explains the scope and context of mental resilience in this research. Section 1.4 outlines the underlying neurobiological mechanism in psychological resilience. Section 1.5 defines a set of stressors investigated in this research, which will be the generic precipitators of maladaptive behavior. Section 1.6 justifies the psychological outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) data from 1990 to 2019, Dattani et al. (2023) described the scope of problem with mental illnesses, reported as prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). The GBD dataset enlists 206 countries and 22 country groups according to the World Health Organization, United Nation, and World Bank classification. The clinical diagnoses included in the GBD dataset is depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, and schizophrenia. The author replicated this approach in table 1 - 5 to elucidate the regional issues based on country-level income grouping. Interestingly, depression is the most prevalent in low-income countries (\\(\\bar{x}\\) [\\(\\sigma\\)]1 = 4.7% [0.04]) and the least prevalent in middle-income country (3.18% [0.06]). Meanwhile, anxiety is the most prevalent in high-income countries (4.84% [0.1]) and the least prevalent in lower-middle-income countries (3.23% [0.09]). The strong and positive association between DALY and prevalence implies the more occurring cases is closely related with increasing burden of diseases. Table 2 - 5 show that all mental illnesses present with cross association, though with a different pattern occurring in high-level income countries compared to the others. Specifically looking at depression and anxiety, high-income countries presented with a positive association while other countries presented with negative associations. To further address this issue, Kessler et al. (2006) with the Assessment, Classification, and Evaluation Group at the WHO initiated World Mental Health (WMH) survey. WMH complements GBD by providing insight on validated mental health burden worldwide, by incorporating the use of lay-administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium 2004).\n1 \\(\\bar{x}\\) \\([\\sigma]\\): mean [standard deviation]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nHigh Income\nN = 30\nLow Income\nN = 30\nLower Middle Income\nN = 30\nMiddle Income\nN = 30\n\n\n\n\nDisability-Adjusted Life Year\n\n\nDepression\n633 (16)\n818 (7)\n654 (38)\n523 (13)\n\n\nSchizophrenia\n210 (2)\n137 (0)\n174 (1)\n188 (1)\n\n\nBipolar\n158 (1)\n117 (1)\n89 (0)\n93 (3)\n\n\nEating Disorder\n85 (3)\n17 (1)\n22 (2)\n28 (4)\n\n\nAnxiety\n462 (9)\n343 (4)\n305 (9)\n378 (8)\n\n\nPrevalence (%)\n\n\nSchizophrenia\n0.33 (0.00)\n0.22 (0.00)\n0.27 (0.00)\n0.29 (0.00)\n\n\nDepression\n3.60 (0.05)\n4.70 (0.04)\n3.84 (0.18)\n3.18 (0.06)\n\n\nAnxiety\n4.84 (0.10)\n3.62 (0.03)\n3.23 (0.09)\n3.94 (0.08)\n\n\nBipolar\n0.73 (0.00)\n0.55 (0.00)\n0.42 (0.00)\n0.43 (0.01)\n\n\nEating Disorder\n0.40 (0.02)\n0.08 (0.00)\n0.10 (0.01)\n0.13 (0.02)\n\n\n\n1 Mean (SD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics of mental health indicators from GBD dataset, adapted from Dattani et al.

While the proportion of severe cases (0.4%-7.7%) in any diagnosis is comparably lower than the prevalence of moderate (0.5%-9.4%) and mild cases (1.8%-9.7%), the impact to productivity is astounding. At least 30 productive days are lost among subjects reporting any severe mental disorder (IQR: 32.1-38.4 days), and accordingly, the number of day loss is lower in subjects with moderate (IQR: 9.2-18.8 days) or mild cases (IQR: 0.1-3.6 days). However, not all cases receives adequate treatment, where the proportion of people receiving treatment is ranging from 0.8% to 15.3% of the affected population. Even though severe cases are more likely to be diagnosed and treated, up to 50.3% of severe cases in developed countries and 85.4% of severe cases in less-developed countries receive no treatment. The proportion of untreated subjects is even higher in moderate and mild cases, ranging from 50%-90.3% and 64.8%-99.5%, respectively. In a follow-up study using WMH data, Kessler et al. (2009) reported that early-onset mental disorders significantly predict a wide range of physical disorders and reduced achievements in a number of role domains. Furthermore, productivity loss due to major depressive disorder in the United States alone is over five weeks of productive-day loss per year, approximated to USD 36 billion of economical loss. Similarly, data from 10 countries participating in WMH survey indicates that an average of 22 productive days loss per worker with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Even though the cause of mental disorder varies widely, its impact to the individual and society is apparent.\n\n\nThis proposal shall outline two facades of depression, i.e. major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms. For brevity, major depressive disorder will be termed as depressive disorder, while the combination of up to four depressive symptoms excluding suicidal ideation will be termed as minor depression. In mental health domain, major depressive disorder is one of the leading cause of disability worldwide. While the prevalence of depressive disorder is only second to anxiety disorder, the impact is immensely dreadful, causing most DALYs for both sexes (Rehm and Shield 2019). Worldwide, depressive disorder has affected over 300 millions people, contributing to 7.5% of years lived with disability. Depressive disorder has a markedly devastating impact from a public health perspective as well, especially taking into account its considerable economic impact. Across the globe, depressive disorder has a lifetime prevalence ranging from 2% in some Asian country to 21% in some European countries (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020). While depressive disorder is the primary determinant of suicidal behavior and immensely impacting the quality of life, an adequate treatment is not well accessible to the majority of patients (Moreno-Agostino et al. 2021).\nThe hallmark of a depressive disorder is the presence of debilitating depressive episodes occurred at least once and lasting at minimum for two weeks. This episode is usually accompanied by changes in mood, perception on pleasure, and cognitive functions (Otte et al. 2016). According to DSM-V, people with depressive disorder may present with the following symptoms:\n\nDepressed mood\nDiminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities\nWeight loss/gain without dieting, accompanied by decrease/increase in appetite\nSleeping problem, manifesting as insomnia or hypersomnia\nPsychomotor agitation or retardation\nLoss of energy\nFeeling of worthlessness and inappropriate guilt which might be delusional\nDiminished ability to think or concentrate\nSuicidal ideation\n\nVarious mechanisms contribute to the development of depressive disorder, including genetic predisposition, brain structure alteration, and changes in the stress-response system (Otte et al. 2016). Genetic contribution is estimated to explain 35% of depressive disorder cases, with possible heritability as demonstrated in family and twin-based studies, a genetic mechanism which also has an interplay with rare mutations. By investigating the biology of depressive disorder, reduced hippocampal volume is apparent in affected subjects, alongside alteration in cognitive network control and affective-salience network. Furthermore, the presence of depressive disorder also implicates stress-response system, indicated by changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the functional state of autonomic nervous system, and the immune system (Otte et al. 2016).\nSpecific groups in the population is at a higher risk of diagnosed with depressive disorder (Otte et al. 2016). The most turbulent time in life contributing to the onset of depressive disorder is between mid-to-late adolescence and early 40s, where the prevalence of depressive disorder is gradually peaking with age before early adulthood. The reported median age of onset of depressive disorder is 25 years old in both sexes, with the risk of developing depressive disorder after puberty in women is twice as high as in men (Otte et al. 2016). The odds of being diagnosed with depressive disorder is 1.4-2.8 times higher in women than in men (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020). Beside age and sex, depressive disorder is also linked to marital status, i.e. being separated/divorced, but the wide confidence interval of 5.0-74.4 causes the estimated effect size rather indeterminate. Though not completely explanatory, Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. (2020) reported other factors contributing to the development of depressive disorder, including employment status, socioeconomic status, education level, physical health, and substance uses. Furthermore, the presence of depressive disorder may also accentuate its association with other mental health-related correlates. Depressive disorder is in particular associated with general anxiety disorder, different classes of phobia, borderline personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder, and neurotic personality trait. Another risk factor to take into account is the history of receiving abusive treatments during childhood, either physical, psychological, or sexual abuse. Each form of abuse has different odds in causing depressive disorder, where adults receiving harsh treatment in early childhood might have 1.6 to 4.1 times of higher odds of diagnosed with depressive disorder (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020).\nPhysical comorbidities of depressive disorder is also frequently reported, where Otte et al. (2016) listed six somatic correlates of depressive disorder, including heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, cognitive impairment, disability, and obesity. Traumatic experience also dysfunction following physical illness are the cornerstones triggering a depressive episode. Specifically in obesity, distorted body image and loss of self-esteem are highly detrimental to the susceptibility of having a depressive disorder. Moreover, biological factors such as altered inflammatory pathways also implicate the pathogenesis of depression (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020). Increased circulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein also become one of the biological explanation underpinning altered inflammatory pathways in its contribution to the development of depressive disorder.\nDepressive disorder and its impact to the patients also poses an economic burden to the society at large. Using WMH survey data from the Netherlands, Cuijpers et al. (2007) estimated the direct and indirect cost of depressive disorder. Similarly reported in other countries, the prevalence of depressive disorder acquired by the WMH survey in the Netherlands was 5.8%. After adjusting to purchasing power parities from OECD, the total economical burden per capita for a year was USD 3,313 (95% CI: USD 1,234-5,390). The calculated associated cost included direct medical cost (USD 478), direct non-medical cost (USD 313), and indirect non-medical cost (USD 2,535).2 Even without fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of a major depressive disorder, having minor depression is also associated with a significant economical cost. The resulting annual cost in people with minor depression was USD 2,141 (95% CI: 753-3,529). Even though the direct medical cost (USD 10) and direct non-medical costs (USD 29) were much lower compared to those with depressive disorder, the indirect non-medical cost was within an overlapping range, amounted to USD 2,101 (95% CI: USD 648-3,518) in minor depression and USD 2,535 (95% CI: USD 549-4,520) in depressive disorder (Cuijpers et al. 2007). Also reported in the USA, the total estimated annual lost due to depressive disorder was USD 16,854 per capita, totalling USD 333.7 billion in 2019 alone. The distribution of cost estimated by Greenberg et al. (2023) is slightly different from Cuijpers et al. (2007) due to the difference in health system, where the total healthcare costs were USD 127.3 billion, household-related costs were USD 80.1 billion, presenteeism was USD 43.3 billion, and absenteeism was USD 38.4 billion. With the steadily increasing prevalence of depressive disorder, it is also apparent that the associated cost is proportionally growing (Greenberg et al. 2021).\n2 The calculation of the economical burden was per Dutch guideline for health economic evaluation. Overall, Cuijpers et al. (2007) provided a thorough and realistic cost estimation. Direct medical costs were defined as health service-related fee to access mental healthcare and medication, including professional fee paid for the general practitioners, social workers, and physiotherapists. Direct non-medical cost were accounted for occurring cost when commuting to access the mental health services, including fee for travel, parking, and time spent when accessing the mental health service. Indirect cost were calculated for productivity loss due to illness.\n\n\nAnxiety is a quite prevalent symptom being addressed in an outpatient setting, with the associated complaints of fear, nervousness, and panic. The presence of anxiety may precede physical issues presenting in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, or nervous systems (Martin 2003). The problem with anxiety and nervousness is as ancient as history, where it was first described by Burton (1621) in The Anatomy of Melancholy.\n\n“Many lamentable effects this fear causeth in man, as to be red, pale, tremble, sweat; it makes sudden cold and heat come over all the body, palpitation of the heart, syncope, etc. It amazeth many men that are to speak or show themselves in public.”\n— Robert Burton\n\nAnxiety itself poses a wide array of problems which may affect individuals since an early age of life. In a meta-analysis, Solmi et al. (2021) demonstrated a bimodal distribution of the age of onset for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and feeding/eating disorders. The peak ages of onset are 5.5 and 15.5 years old for anxiety and fear-related disorders, 14.5 and 49.5 years old for obsessive-compulsive or related disorders, and 15.5 years old for feeding or eating disorders. Evaluating the peak age of each group, it is sensible that problems related to anxiety may emerge since early childhood and re-emerge during adolescent or late adulthood. After all, these disorders share similar underlying mechanism, i.e. stemming from anxious feelings and nervousness. In this proposal, anxiety disorder is narrowed down to only include anxiety and fear-related disorders, comprising generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder.\nRelying on the diagnostic criteria provided by DSM-V, anxiety disorder can be determined in case the presence of excessive worry for at least six months (DeMartini, Patel, and Fancher 2019). Worry and nervousness in an anxiety disorder is expected to be volatile, i.e. one day with less worry than the others, yet it still persists that the number of days feeling worried dominates the rest. The occurring nervousness is quite difficult to control and rationalize, hence impeding the affected individuals from performing day-to-day activities. Worry and nervousness in an anxiety disorder are also associated with at least three of the following symptoms:\n\nRestlessness or feeling on edge\nEasily fatigued or feeling drained\nDifficulty in concentrating\nBeing irritable\nMuscle tension\nSleep disturbances, which could present as any form of insomnia, i.e. difficulty falling asleep, restless during sleep, or unsatisfying sleep\n\nWith the recent WMH survey suggested that the prevalence of anxiety disorder is ranging from 2.4% to 18.2%, it is clear that there are several uncertainties in determining its global prevalence. Previous meta-regression model supported this claim by highlighting different odds ratio in included covariates when determining the heterogeneity of anxiety disorder prevalence. In their meta-regression model, Baxter et al. (2012) fitted covariates that might influence the prevalence of anxiety disorder, grouped by its substantive factors and methodological factors. Identified covariates in the substantive factors are gender, age group, conflict status, culture, economic status, and urbanicity. Meanwhile, identified covariates in the methodological factors are prevalence type, survey instrument, and number of disorders.\nEach covariate from the substantive factors contribute to explaining the heterogeneity of anxiety disorder prevalence (Baxter et al. 2012). Consistent with findings on other mental disorders, women are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with anxiety disorder, with an adjusted OR of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2-2.3) and predicted global prevalence of 9.9% (95% CI: 6.6%-14.8%). By using 35-54 year-old group as a reference, only older adults (55+ years old) are at a lower risk of having an anxiety disorder, with an adjusted OR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.9) and predicted global prevalence of 6.7% (95% CI: 4.4%-10.1%). Younger adults (18-34 years old) and adolescents (3-17 years old) are at the same odds of having anxiety disorder as those aged 35-54 years old, with the predicted global prevalence ranging from 4.7% to 12.5%. The presence of conflict in daily life increases the odds of having anxiety disorder, with predicted global prevalence of 9% (95% CI: 5.9%-13.6%). Using the European and Anglosaxon group as a reference, other cultures are at a lower odds of diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Interestingly, emerging and developed countries are more likely to be affected by anxiety disorder compared to developing country, with a higher odds ratio ranging from 1.1 to 1.9. In contrast, people in urban area are less likely to be affected by anxiety disorder compared to people living in rural area, with a markedly lower predicted global prevalence of 8.4% (95% CI: 5.5%-13%).\nNaturally, the heterogeneity of predicted global prevalence is also affected by methodological factors, but only to a lesser degree. The identified contributing covariates to the heterogeneity are the use of past-year prevalence and the presence of multiple disorders. Contributing factors of the heterogeneity is, of course, not to be taken at its face value. These factors do not necessarily define the causality or direct inferential association. Despite uncertain estimates of the global prevalence, the predicted prevalence of 7.3% by Baxter et al. (2012) is highly in line with and confirming findings obtained by WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium (2004).\n\n\n\nClinicians face challenges in identifying clinical burnout as it’s not officially recognized in DSM-5 or ICD-10. Diverse labels such as work-related neuroasthenia, somatoform or adjustment disorders, severe stress reactions, and even depression are employed to define burnout, resulting in inconsistent evaluation. Solely relying on questionnaires poses a challenge in distinguishing between mild stress and clinical burnout, as short-term stress can raise burnout indicators similarly to major depression or anxiety. The distinction between short-term work-related stress and clinical burnout lies in their respective coping mechanisms and the evolution of symptoms over time. Short-term stress often emerges in response to immediate stressors like conflicts at work, increased workload, or organizational changes, prompting individuals to seek help within a few months—an indication of healthy coping strategies (Dam 2021).\nIn contrast, clinical burnout patients tend to overlook stress symptoms for extended periods, sometimes years, as living with chronic stress becomes their norm. The final collapse often stems from seemingly minor stressors, acting as the tipping point after prolonged exposure to chronic stress. Unlike those with short-term stress, individuals experiencing burnout don’t readily seek assistance during stress but persist stoically without vocalizing their distress. This perseverance characterizes their coping style, coupled with an aversion to seeking social support. While perseverance might be protective in certain situations where an individual maintains control, it becomes maladaptive without control, contributing to chronic stress maintenance. Surprisingly, burnout patients, despite experiencing fatigue, don’t tend to adjust their performance strategies by adopting less demanding approaches, contrary to what’s observed in fatigued yet healthy individuals. Instead, they exhibit a persistent drive to sustain high task performance standards (Dam 2021).\nThe transition from short-term stress to clinical burnout is marked by how individuals respond to stress, the duration of symptom neglect, and their coping strategies. While short-term stress prompts immediate seeking of help, burnout evolves silently over time, propelled by chronic stress and perseverance. The development of clinical burnout is first marked by the lack of recovery, where affected subjects tend to express aversion to spending effort in recognizing their problems. Second, physiological changes of stress-response system take place, manifesting as sleep difficulties, inability to relax, and restlessness. Third, chronic stress symptoms emerge, leading to physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral issues. During this phase, affected subjects may complain of intestinal problem, musculoskeletal pain, or fatigue. Fourth, pseudopsychopathology begins to get noticeable, signified by applying more rigid problem solving and simplified cognitive process. Fifth, the clinical burnout becomes apparent with reduced motivation, emotional breakdown, severe fatigue, and passivity (Dam 2021). As outlined by Kaschka, Korczak, and Broich (2011) in figure 1, the phases of burnout may continuously happen as an active and passive processes. The active process of burnout strongly associates with personality and internal factors, while the active process of burnout relates with external factors.\nInternal factors of ongoing burnout:\n\nElevated personal expectations driven by idealism\nIntense desire for recognition and validation\nConsistent inclination to please other people over personal needs\nReluctance to assign tasks to others\nExcessive dedication leading to self-overestimation\nConsidering work as the sole meaningful pursuit, replacing social interactions\n\nExternal factors of ongoing burnout:\n\nHigh work demands\nLeadership and collaboration issues\nConflicting instructions\nTime constraints and urgency\nHostile work environment, including bullying\nLimited decision-making freedom\nInadequate influence on work organization\nLimited participation opportunities\nRestricted autonomy in expressing opinions\nHierarchy-related challenges\nIneffective internal communication between employers and employees\nAdministrative limitations\nPressure exerted by superiors\nEscalating responsibilities\nInefficient work organization\nScarcity of resources (staff, funding)\nDysfunctional institutional regulations\nPerceived absence of promotion at work\nUnclear job roles\nDeficient positive reinforcement\nInadequate team synergy\nLack of social support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The type of burnout, as outlined by Kaschka, Korczak, and Broich (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested by Moss et al. (2019) in the Harvard Business Review, burnout is a workplace-related issue, not merely individual problems. Annually, the United States spend approximately USD 190 billion due to workplace stress, nearly 8% of their national healthcare expenditure. Beyond economic cost, workplace stress also poses an imminent danger, contributing to 120,000 deaths each year (Goh, Pfeffer, and Zenios 2016). A study involving 375 stressed employees from the Australian mining sector revealed that 23.4% had missed work due to health issues, and 6.7% struggled to focus at work because of health problems in the past month. On average, stressed employees’ work efficiency decreased by 33.6%, resulting in an average cost of USD 45,000 per employee. Notably, persistent work-related stress significantly escalated costs, far surpassing those with occasional or moderate stress, emphasizing the substantial impact of stress on productivity (Street, Lacey, and Somoray 2018). Insufficient social support leads to heightened stress, while higher job performance correlates with reduced stress levels. Work-life conflict significantly contributes to workplace stress, which may increase the perceived stress level. This underscores the challenge organizations face in balancing flexible work setups and optimal performance, where prolonged exposure to work-related stress negatively affects performance and well-being. Conversely, fostering a supportive work environment and promoting social interaction and organizational support can alleviate stress. Leaders focusing on the work environment and encouraging social support play a crucial role in diminishing employee stress levels (Foy et al. 2019).\n\n\n\n\nAttachment Theory, as proposed by Bowlby (1973), revolves around the importance of attachment-based strategies in managing emotions. It explores how various interactions with important individuals mold these strategies. Bowlby suggested that infants possess inherent attachment behaviors geared toward seeking closeness to supportive figures, serving as a primary strategy to alleviate distress and foster a feeling of security. The theory highlights the evolutionary significance of this attachment system, aiding the survival of infants reliant on caregivers due to their limitations. Bowlby stressed that this system operates across an individual’s lifespan, shaping behaviors related to seeking support. He outlined three key roles for an attachment figure: maintaining proximity, offering a secure haven for comfort during distress, and providing a secure base for exploration and growth.\nBowlby also emphasized individual differences in attachment functioning, noting that responsive and available interactions foster a sense of security, while unavailability leads to negative self-perceptions and alternative strategies for managing emotions beyond seeking closeness. These variations give rise to attachment styles, initially categorized as secure, anxious, and avoidant in infancy, which later evolve into a two-dimensional space based on attachment anxiety and avoidance in adult relationships. The secure style reflects low levels of anxiety and avoidance, indicating comfort with intimacy and assurance in relationships. Anxious attachment indicates high anxiety and low avoidance, displaying a strong need for closeness coupled with fear of rejection. Conversely, the avoidant style represents high avoidance, signaling a preference for independence and emotional distance.\nBoth anxious and avoidant styles signify the failure of seeking closeness to ease distress, leading to secondary strategies for managing emotions. Bowlby’s theory suggests that seeking closeness serves as the primary strategy for regulating emotions, with attachment experiences shaping additional strategies. This comprehension illuminates the complexities of emotional regulation and its influence on relationships, stemming from early interactions and impacting behavior throughout an individual’s life (Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg 2003). Activation of the attachment style in adult corresponds to the imminent threat and perceived danger, as shown by figure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Activation and dynamics of the attachment system proposed by Mikulincer, Gillath, and Shaver (2002)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a general context, eliciting negative affect will produce different behaviors among people with secure and insecure attachment styles, specifically for sociotropic and autonomous stressors. Sociotropic stressors are those related to interpersonal loss and social rejection, while autonomous stressors are those emerging from the violation of one’s internal standards. Though no strong justification in drawing a clear boundary between sociotropic and autonomous stressors, especially due to their interrelatedness, different patterns emerge when the stressors are perceived by subjects with different attachment styles. People exhibiting insecure attachment styles, whether dismissive or anxious, showed greater susceptibility to sociotropic events. Dismissive individuals, owing to their detached and emotionally distant behavior, faced increased vulnerability to future sociotropic events, resulting in interpersonal difficulties. Conversely, anxious individuals might undergo heightened distress levels because they interpret conflicts as signs of emotional connection, leading to strain in their interpersonal relationships (Bottonari et al. 2007).\n\n\n\nResilience can be seen as a trait or a state of a human psyche, where resilience as a trait covers contributing internal factors that help the individual to overcome adversities. As a state, resilience is best defined as a dynamic adaptive behavior that emerges due to circumstantial changes. Several constituents of resilience as a trait includes habitual effective coping mechanism and positive emotions, both act as a buffer against negative life events (Davydov et al. 2010). Meanwhile, as a state, resilience is a dynamic capacity to adapt supported by the interaction of internal and external factors, including biological, psychological, social, and ecological systems (Ungar and Theron 2020). Resilience as a trait is observable as a non-adaptive countermeasures, where the individual will act against the stressful events, i.e. being resistant to adversities. On the other hand, resilience as state is an adaptive transformation to prevent persistent dysfunction or psychopathology (Davydov et al. 2010), thus, will be better suited for any modelling and policy-directed research.\nThe intertwining facade of the trait and state of resilience is explainable as an inherent activities of neurocircuitries (Rutten et al. 2013), where gene-environmental interactions play a role in determining individual susceptibility to psychiatric illness (resilience as a trait) (Amstadter, Myers, and Kendler 2014). Also, there exists biological mechanism that allow experience-dependant plasticity and fuel up adaptability (resilience as a state) (Derakhshan 2020; Rutten et al. 2013). By considering both sides of resilience, This research is concerned with the latter aspect, where maintaining an adaptive behavior is of essence to abate the development of mental disorder.\n\n\n\nThe mechanisms underlying the neurobiology of resilience involve intricate neural circuits governing stress response and reward experiences. Feedback mechanisms within the brain and body regulate stress reactions, pivotal for sustained health and reducing mental health disturbances post-severe adversities. Major neural systems controlling stress response include the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system, and dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. Activation of the HPA axis triggers the release of hormones like corticotrophin releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone, leading to the production of glucocorticoids. While short-term elevation of cortisol aids adaptive behavior, prolonged high cortisol levels can impede neurogenesis. The neurocircuitry governing reward experiences centers on mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways from the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). This system integrates sensory input and cognitive control, regulating dopamine release in the VTA. Connections with other brain regions contribute to the activity of this circuitry (Rutten et al. 2013).\nTogether with HPA axis, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in stress response, where hyperactive mPFC generate depression-like behavior. The hippocampus, crucial for regulating the stress response, demonstrates vulnerability to stress; its dysfunction is associated with depression, and circuits from the hippocampus to other brain areas influence resilience to stress. GABAergic receptors in the hippocampus and dopaminergic pathways from the VTA to the NAc impact stress resilience, where impaired GABAergic neurons in the NAc elicits depression-like behaviors. Stress during early life can have lasting effects on mental health, yet mild stress exposure early on might enhance resilience. As such, adverse childhood experiences correlate with increased risk for psychological and physical diseases later in life, while stress inoculation during childhood may improve resilience (Liu et al. 2018).\nFurthermore, an aberrant regulation within cellular and molecular levels can influence resilience or stress response, emphasizing the role of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic moderation of environmental sensitivity explains individual responses to similar environments, revealing interactions between genes and environment as critical for outcomes. Stressful events can heighten psychiatric risk in individuals carrying specific gene variants like 5HTT, FKBP5, and CRH1. Epigenetics, regulating gene transcription independent of DNA sequence, profoundly influences adaptation to external stimuli. Mechanisms like DNA methylation and chromatin structure changes impact brain development, neurogenesis, and cognitive functions like memory and learning, implying its role in individual stress responses. Epigenetic mechanisms underpin individual variation in response to environmental exposures, influencing neurobiological processes during development and aging (Rutten et al. 2013).\nA healthy response to stress is crucial for long-term well-being and reduced mental health issues following exposure to severe adversity. Critical neural systems governing stress responses, including the HPA axis, the sympathetic nervous system, and neurotransmitter systems like dopamine and serotonin, play pivotal roles. Genetic factors contribute significantly to how individuals respond to stress in the same environment, illustrating the interplay between genetics and the environment. Mechanisms influenced by experiences at cellular, subcellular, and molecular levels shape the way experiences are imprinted, impacting neural adaptability and sensitivity. While human studies emphasize the importance of social networks and positive experiences in resilience, replicating these in animal models remains a challenge. Resilience isn’t just an absence of risk; it comprises distinct biological and psychological traits that aid successful adaptation or swift recovery from adversity-induced mental health issues. Exposure to multiple adverse events during development can sensitize an individual’s behavior and central nervous system, potentially leading to susceptibility to psychiatric disorders (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019).\n\n\n\nResilience is the moderator between risk factors and psychological disorders, therefore, a clear definition of included stressors will aid in developing an explainable and generalizable study design (Ungar and Theron 2020). Defining the stressors also allow us to measure resilience using a reactivity approach, where resilience is evaluated as growing tolerance to regular stress (Davydov et al. 2010). This way we can partly assess the dynamic process in developing an adaptive behavior.\nThe presence of stressors disrupts physiological function to a lower utility state (Oken, Chamine, and Wakeland 2015). Following the methods proposed by Veer et al. (2021), our research evaluates two distinct groups of stressor, namely the general daily stressor and health-related stressor. The general stressor is an instrument comprising ten items of daily hassles and life events, while the health-related stressor consists of items reflecting adversity related to general health concern in self, families, and close relatives. Any item rated as \"TRUE\" is then weighted for the severity, ranging from not burdensome (0) to substantially burdensome (5). Below is the excerpt of the general stressor items:\n\nNegative political events\nConflicts with relatives or colleagues\nFinancial problems\nPhysical health problems\nMental health problems\nBurdensome experiences with family\nBurdensome experiences in workplace\nConflicts with strangers\nSeparation from a loved one, which triggers reduced social contact and loneliness\nDeath of a loved one\n\nThe health-related stressor in Veer et al. (2021) was particularly narrating distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In brief, these items are comprised of trepidation or perceived burden due to a disease, thus adaptable for a more general research context.\n\n\n\nDepression, anxiety, and burnout are selected as outcomes of interest due to the relatedness between burnout \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) depression and burnout \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) anxiety (Koutsimani, Montgomery, and Georganta 2019). The partial correlations have a moderate effect size, signifying the boundary between burnout and depression also burnout and anxiety. Therefore, statistically, each of depression, anxiety, and burnout does not share similar latent construct even though they have closely-related manifests. This is interpretable as distinctive remarks to differentiate three of such outcomes and the clinical importance of examining the others when one is present.\nBurnout is a condition of increasing depersonalization and emotional exhaustion, leading to reduced personal accomplishment in the workplace (sense of inefficacy). Burnout often happens due to a long-term ongoing stressor, where the inability to cope with external issues decreases work engagement (Schaufeli 2017). The incidence of burnout overlaps with psychological distress, marked by depressive symptoms or anxiety.\nIn a recent finding, burnout is partially explainable by depression and anxiety. Depression symptoms pose similar characteristics to exhaustion and depersonalization, while anxiety is related to the sense of personal inefficacy (Golonka et al. 2019). In theory, depression is marked by the loss of energy (fatigue) and anxiety is marked by being excessively worried; but a study suggested the presence of anxious depression (Gaspersz et al. 2018), which in turn also implies a pathophysiological overlap between depression and anxiety. Moreover, lower brain connectivity in the default mode network is a curious co-occurrence between depression (Jacob et al. 2020), anxiety (Imperatori et al. 2019), and burnout (Shang et al. 2022). Neurobiological, clinical, and contextual overlaps between depression, anxiety, and burnout necessitate the inclusion of these outcomes to infer a more general impact of associated stressors.\nSeveral policies have been implemented to alleviate the mental health burden in Indonesia, mainly highlighted in the Mental Health Act in 2014 (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021), and further defined in the Indonesian Minister of Health Regulation Number 77 of 2015 and Indonesian Minister of Health Regulation Number 54 of 2017 (Hartono, Mandowen, and Asmorowati 2018). During the pandemic, the government of Indonesia has stipulated a Presidential Decree R1 No. 7 of 2020 to promptly respond the pandemic; however, the practical implementation has not addressed mental health issues. Though, several ongoing initiatives led by the government has been realized as a regulation on managing a digital counselling platform (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). The digital platform, conducted through various chat-based and video call-based application, helps the general population to get in touch with therapists, psychologists, counselors, and educational practitioners (Ifdil et al. 2020). Tele-consulting, either through chat or video call, enables practitioners to provide psychological first aid to address elevated distress during the pandemic, depression, and anxiety (Ifdil et al. 2020).",

    "text": "Using Global Burden of Diseases (GBD) data from 1990 to 2019, Dattani et al. (2023) described the scope of problem with mental illnesses, reported as prevalence and disability-adjusted life years (DALY). The GBD dataset enlists 206 countries and 22 country groups according to the World Health Organization, United Nation, and World Bank classification. The clinical diagnoses included in the GBD dataset is depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, and schizophrenia. The author replicated this approach in table 1 - 5 to elucidate the regional issues based on country-level income grouping. Interestingly, depression is the most prevalent in low-income countries (\\(\\bar{x}\\) [\\(\\sigma\\)]1 = 4.7% [0.04]) and the least prevalent in middle-income country (3.18% [0.06]). Meanwhile, anxiety is the most prevalent in high-income countries (4.84% [0.1]) and the least prevalent in lower-middle-income countries (3.23% [0.09]). The strong and positive association between DALY and prevalence implies the more occurring cases is closely related with increasing burden of diseases. Table 2 - 5 show that all mental illnesses present with cross association, though with a different pattern occurring in high-level income countries compared to the others. Specifically looking at depression and anxiety, high-income countries presented with a positive association while other countries presented with negative associations. To further address this issue, Kessler et al. (2006) with the Assessment, Classification, and Evaluation Group at the WHO initiated World Mental Health (WMH) survey. WMH complements GBD by providing insight on validated mental health burden worldwide, by incorporating the use of lay-administered Composite International Diagnostic Interview for DSM-IV (WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium 2004).\n1 \\(\\bar{x}\\) \\([\\sigma]\\): mean [standard deviation]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nHigh Income\nN = 30\nLow Income\nN = 30\nLower Middle Income\nN = 30\nMiddle Income\nN = 30\n\n\n\n\nDisability-Adjusted Life Year\n\n\nDepression\n633 (16)\n818 (7)\n654 (38)\n523 (13)\n\n\nSchizophrenia\n210 (2)\n137 (0)\n174 (1)\n188 (1)\n\n\nBipolar\n158 (1)\n117 (1)\n89 (0)\n93 (3)\n\n\nEating Disorder\n85 (3)\n17 (1)\n22 (2)\n28 (4)\n\n\nAnxiety\n462 (9)\n343 (4)\n305 (9)\n378 (8)\n\n\nPrevalence (%)\n\n\nSchizophrenia\n0.33 (0.00)\n0.22 (0.00)\n0.27 (0.00)\n0.29 (0.00)\n\n\nDepression\n3.60 (0.05)\n4.70 (0.04)\n3.84 (0.18)\n3.18 (0.06)\n\n\nAnxiety\n4.84 (0.10)\n3.62 (0.03)\n3.23 (0.09)\n3.94 (0.08)\n\n\nBipolar\n0.73 (0.00)\n0.55 (0.00)\n0.42 (0.00)\n0.43 (0.01)\n\n\nEating Disorder\n0.40 (0.02)\n0.08 (0.00)\n0.10 (0.01)\n0.13 (0.02)\n\n\n\n1 Mean (SD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Descriptive statistics of mental health indicators from GBD dataset, adapted from Dattani et al.

While the proportion of severe cases (0.4%-7.7%) in any diagnosis is comparably lower than the prevalence of moderate (0.5%-9.4%) and mild cases (1.8%-9.7%), the impact to productivity is astounding. At least 30 productive days are lost among subjects reporting any severe mental disorder (IQR: 32.1-38.4 days), and accordingly, the number of day loss is lower in subjects with moderate (IQR: 9.2-18.8 days) or mild cases (IQR: 0.1-3.6 days). However, not all cases receives adequate treatment, where the proportion of people receiving treatment is ranging from 0.8% to 15.3% of the affected population. Even though severe cases are more likely to be diagnosed and treated, up to 50.3% of severe cases in developed countries and 85.4% of severe cases in less-developed countries receive no treatment. The proportion of untreated subjects is even higher in moderate and mild cases, ranging from 50%-90.3% and 64.8%-99.5%, respectively. In a follow-up study using WMH data, Kessler et al. (2009) reported that early-onset mental disorders significantly predict a wide range of physical disorders and reduced achievements in a number of role domains. Furthermore, productivity loss due to major depressive disorder in the United States alone is over five weeks of productive-day loss per year, approximated to USD 36 billion of economical loss. Similarly, data from 10 countries participating in WMH survey indicates that an average of 22 productive days loss per worker with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Even though the cause of mental disorder varies widely, its impact to the individual and society is apparent.\n\n\nThis proposal shall outline two facades of depression, i.e. major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms. For brevity, major depressive disorder will be termed as depressive disorder, while the combination of up to four depressive symptoms excluding suicidal ideation will be termed as minor depression. In mental health domain, major depressive disorder is one of the leading cause of disability worldwide. While the prevalence of depressive disorder is only second to anxiety disorder, the impact is immensely dreadful, causing most DALYs for both sexes (Rehm and Shield 2019). Worldwide, depressive disorder has affected over 300 millions people, contributing to 7.5% of years lived with disability. Depressive disorder has a markedly devastating impact from a public health perspective as well, especially taking into account its considerable economic impact. Across the globe, depressive disorder has a lifetime prevalence ranging from 2% in some Asian country to 21% in some European countries (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020). While depressive disorder is the primary determinant of suicidal behavior and immensely impacting the quality of life, an adequate treatment is not well accessible to the majority of patients (Moreno-Agostino et al. 2021).\nThe hallmark of a depressive disorder is the presence of debilitating depressive episodes occurred at least once and lasting at minimum for two weeks. This episode is usually accompanied by changes in mood, perception on pleasure, and cognitive functions (Otte et al. 2016). According to DSM-V, people with depressive disorder may present with the following symptoms:\n\nDepressed mood\nDiminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities\nWeight loss/gain without dieting, accompanied by decrease/increase in appetite\nSleeping problem, manifesting as insomnia or hypersomnia\nPsychomotor agitation or retardation\nLoss of energy\nFeeling of worthlessness and inappropriate guilt which might be delusional\nDiminished ability to think or concentrate\nSuicidal ideation\n\nVarious mechanisms contribute to the development of depressive disorder, including genetic predisposition, brain structure alteration, and changes in the stress-response system (Otte et al. 2016). Genetic contribution is estimated to explain 35% of depressive disorder cases, with possible heritability as demonstrated in family and twin-based studies, a genetic mechanism which also has an interplay with rare mutations. By investigating the biology of depressive disorder, reduced hippocampal volume is apparent in affected subjects, alongside alteration in cognitive network control and affective-salience network. Furthermore, the presence of depressive disorder also implicates stress-response system, indicated by changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the functional state of autonomic nervous system, and the immune system (Otte et al. 2016).\nSpecific groups in the population is at a higher risk of diagnosed with depressive disorder (Otte et al. 2016). The most turbulent time in life contributing to the onset of depressive disorder is between mid-to-late adolescence and early 40s, where the prevalence of depressive disorder is gradually peaking with age before early adulthood. The reported median age of onset of depressive disorder is 25 years old in both sexes, with the risk of developing depressive disorder after puberty in women is twice as high as in men (Otte et al. 2016). The odds of being diagnosed with depressive disorder is 1.4-2.8 times higher in women than in men (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020). Beside age and sex, depressive disorder is also linked to marital status, i.e. being separated/divorced, but the wide confidence interval of 5.0-74.4 causes the estimated effect size rather indeterminate. Though not completely explanatory, Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. (2020) reported other factors contributing to the development of depressive disorder, including employment status, socioeconomic status, education level, physical health, and substance uses. Furthermore, the presence of depressive disorder may also accentuate its association with other mental health-related correlates. Depressive disorder is in particular associated with general anxiety disorder, different classes of phobia, borderline personality disorder, paranoid personality disorder, and neurotic personality trait. Another risk factor to take into account is the history of receiving abusive treatments during childhood, either physical, psychological, or sexual abuse. Each form of abuse has different odds in causing depressive disorder, where adults receiving harsh treatment in early childhood might have 1.6 to 4.1 times of higher odds of diagnosed with depressive disorder (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020).\nPhysical comorbidities of depressive disorder is also frequently reported, where Otte et al. (2016) listed six somatic correlates of depressive disorder, including heart disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, cognitive impairment, disability, and obesity. Traumatic experience also dysfunction following physical illness are the cornerstones triggering a depressive episode. Specifically in obesity, distorted body image and loss of self-esteem are highly detrimental to the susceptibility of having a depressive disorder. Moreover, biological factors such as altered inflammatory pathways also implicate the pathogenesis of depression (Gutiérrez-Rojas et al. 2020). Increased circulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and C-reactive protein also become one of the biological explanation underpinning altered inflammatory pathways in its contribution to the development of depressive disorder.\nDepressive disorder and its impact to the patients also poses an economic burden to the society at large. Using WMH survey data from the Netherlands, Cuijpers et al. (2007) estimated the direct and indirect cost of depressive disorder. Similarly reported in other countries, the prevalence of depressive disorder acquired by the WMH survey in the Netherlands was 5.8%. After adjusting to purchasing power parities from OECD, the total economical burden per capita for a year was USD 3,313 (95% CI: USD 1,234-5,390). The calculated associated cost included direct medical cost (USD 478), direct non-medical cost (USD 313), and indirect non-medical cost (USD 2,535).2 Even without fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of a major depressive disorder, having minor depression is also associated with a significant economical cost. The resulting annual cost in people with minor depression was USD 2,141 (95% CI: 753-3,529). Even though the direct medical cost (USD 10) and direct non-medical costs (USD 29) were much lower compared to those with depressive disorder, the indirect non-medical cost was within an overlapping range, amounted to USD 2,101 (95% CI: USD 648-3,518) in minor depression and USD 2,535 (95% CI: USD 549-4,520) in depressive disorder (Cuijpers et al. 2007). Also reported in the USA, the total estimated annual lost due to depressive disorder was USD 16,854 per capita, totalling USD 333.7 billion in 2019 alone. The distribution of cost estimated by Greenberg et al. (2023) is slightly different from Cuijpers et al. (2007) due to the difference in health system, where the total healthcare costs were USD 127.3 billion, household-related costs were USD 80.1 billion, presenteeism was USD 43.3 billion, and absenteeism was USD 38.4 billion. With the steadily increasing prevalence of depressive disorder, it is also apparent that the associated cost is proportionally growing (Greenberg et al. 2021).\n2 The calculation of the economical burden was per Dutch guideline for health economic evaluation. Overall, Cuijpers et al. (2007) provided a thorough and realistic cost estimation. Direct medical costs were defined as health service-related fee to access mental healthcare and medication, including professional fee paid for the general practitioners, social workers, and physiotherapists. Direct non-medical cost were accounted for occurring cost when commuting to access the mental health services, including fee for travel, parking, and time spent when accessing the mental health service. Indirect cost were calculated for productivity loss due to illness.\n\n\nAnxiety is a quite prevalent symptom being addressed in an outpatient setting, with the associated complaints of fear, nervousness, and panic. The presence of anxiety may precede physical issues presenting in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, musculoskeletal, or nervous systems (Martin 2003). The problem with anxiety and nervousness is as ancient as history, where it was first described by Burton (1621) in The Anatomy of Melancholy.\n\n“Many lamentable effects this fear causeth in man, as to be red, pale, tremble, sweat; it makes sudden cold and heat come over all the body, palpitation of the heart, syncope, etc. It amazeth many men that are to speak or show themselves in public.”\n— Robert Burton\n\nAnxiety itself poses a wide array of problems which may affect individuals since an early age of life. In a meta-analysis, Solmi et al. (2021) demonstrated a bimodal distribution of the age of onset for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and feeding/eating disorders. The peak ages of onset are 5.5 and 15.5 years old for anxiety and fear-related disorders, 14.5 and 49.5 years old for obsessive-compulsive or related disorders, and 15.5 years old for feeding or eating disorders. Evaluating the peak age of each group, it is sensible that problems related to anxiety may emerge since early childhood and re-emerge during adolescent or late adulthood. After all, these disorders share similar underlying mechanism, i.e. stemming from anxious feelings and nervousness. In this proposal, anxiety disorder is narrowed down to only include anxiety and fear-related disorders, comprising generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder.\nRelying on the diagnostic criteria provided by DSM-V, anxiety disorder can be determined in case the presence of excessive worry for at least six months (DeMartini, Patel, and Fancher 2019). Worry and nervousness in an anxiety disorder is expected to be volatile, i.e. one day with less worry than the others, yet it still persists that the number of days feeling worried dominates the rest. The occurring nervousness is quite difficult to control and rationalize, hence impeding the affected individuals from performing day-to-day activities. Worry and nervousness in an anxiety disorder are also associated with at least three of the following symptoms:\n\nRestlessness or feeling on edge\nEasily fatigued or feeling drained\nDifficulty in concentrating\nBeing irritable\nMuscle tension\nSleep disturbances, which could present as any form of insomnia, i.e. difficulty falling asleep, restless during sleep, or unsatisfying sleep\n\nWith the recent WMH survey suggested that the prevalence of anxiety disorder is ranging from 2.4% to 18.2%, it is clear that there are several uncertainties in determining its global prevalence. Previous meta-regression model supported this claim by highlighting different odds ratio in included covariates when determining the heterogeneity of anxiety disorder prevalence. In their meta-regression model, Baxter et al. (2012) fitted covariates that might influence the prevalence of anxiety disorder, grouped by its substantive factors and methodological factors. Identified covariates in the substantive factors are gender, age group, conflict status, culture, economic status, and urbanicity. Meanwhile, identified covariates in the methodological factors are prevalence type, survey instrument, and number of disorders.\nEach covariate from the substantive factors contribute to explaining the heterogeneity of anxiety disorder prevalence (Baxter et al. 2012). Consistent with findings on other mental disorders, women are at a higher risk of being diagnosed with anxiety disorder, with an adjusted OR of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.2-2.3) and predicted global prevalence of 9.9% (95% CI: 6.6%-14.8%). By using 35-54 year-old group as a reference, only older adults (55+ years old) are at a lower risk of having an anxiety disorder, with an adjusted OR of 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7-0.9) and predicted global prevalence of 6.7% (95% CI: 4.4%-10.1%). Younger adults (18-34 years old) and adolescents (3-17 years old) are at the same odds of having anxiety disorder as those aged 35-54 years old, with the predicted global prevalence ranging from 4.7% to 12.5%. The presence of conflict in daily life increases the odds of having anxiety disorder, with predicted global prevalence of 9% (95% CI: 5.9%-13.6%). Using the European and Anglosaxon group as a reference, other cultures are at a lower odds of diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Interestingly, emerging and developed countries are more likely to be affected by anxiety disorder compared to developing country, with a higher odds ratio ranging from 1.1 to 1.9. In contrast, people in urban area are less likely to be affected by anxiety disorder compared to people living in rural area, with a markedly lower predicted global prevalence of 8.4% (95% CI: 5.5%-13%).\nNaturally, the heterogeneity of predicted global prevalence is also affected by methodological factors, but only to a lesser degree. The identified contributing covariates to the heterogeneity are the use of past-year prevalence and the presence of multiple disorders. Contributing factors of the heterogeneity is, of course, not to be taken at its face value. These factors do not necessarily define the causality or direct inferential association. Despite uncertain estimates of the global prevalence, the predicted prevalence of 7.3% by Baxter et al. (2012) is highly in line with and confirming findings obtained by WHO World Mental Health Survey Consortium (2004).\n\n\n\nClinicians face challenges in identifying clinical burnout as it’s not officially recognized in DSM-5 or ICD-10. Diverse labels such as work-related neuroasthenia, somatoform or adjustment disorders, severe stress reactions, and even depression are employed to define burnout, resulting in inconsistent evaluation. Solely relying on questionnaires poses a challenge in distinguishing between mild stress and clinical burnout, as short-term stress can raise burnout indicators similarly to major depression or anxiety. The distinction between short-term work-related stress and clinical burnout lies in their respective coping mechanisms and the evolution of symptoms over time. Short-term stress often emerges in response to immediate stressors like conflicts at work, increased workload, or organizational changes, prompting individuals to seek help within a few months—an indication of healthy coping strategies (Dam 2021).\nIn contrast, clinical burnout patients tend to overlook stress symptoms for extended periods, sometimes years, as living with chronic stress becomes their norm. The final collapse often stems from seemingly minor stressors, acting as the tipping point after prolonged exposure to chronic stress. Unlike those with short-term stress, individuals experiencing burnout don’t readily seek assistance during stress but persist stoically without vocalizing their distress. This perseverance characterizes their coping style, coupled with an aversion to seeking social support. While perseverance might be protective in certain situations where an individual maintains control, it becomes maladaptive without control, contributing to chronic stress maintenance. Surprisingly, burnout patients, despite experiencing fatigue, don’t tend to adjust their performance strategies by adopting less demanding approaches, contrary to what’s observed in fatigued yet healthy individuals. Instead, they exhibit a persistent drive to sustain high task performance standards (Dam 2021).\nThe transition from short-term stress to clinical burnout is marked by how individuals respond to stress, the duration of symptom neglect, and their coping strategies. While short-term stress prompts immediate seeking of help, burnout evolves silently over time, propelled by chronic stress and perseverance. The development of clinical burnout is first marked by the lack of recovery, where affected subjects tend to express aversion to spending effort in recognizing their problems. Second, physiological changes of stress-response system take place, manifesting as sleep difficulties, inability to relax, and restlessness. Third, chronic stress symptoms emerge, leading to physical, mental, emotional, and behavioral issues. During this phase, affected subjects may complain of intestinal problem, musculoskeletal pain, or fatigue. Fourth, pseudopsychopathology begins to get noticeable, signified by applying more rigid problem solving and simplified cognitive process. Fifth, the clinical burnout becomes apparent with reduced motivation, emotional breakdown, severe fatigue, and passivity (Dam 2021). As outlined by Kaschka, Korczak, and Broich (2011) in figure 1, the phases of burnout may continuously happen as an active and passive processes. The active process of burnout strongly associates with personality and internal factors, while the active process of burnout relates with external factors.\nInternal factors of ongoing burnout:\n\nElevated personal expectations driven by idealism\nIntense desire for recognition and validation\nConsistent inclination to please other people over personal needs\nReluctance to assign tasks to others\nExcessive dedication leading to self-overestimation\nConsidering work as the sole meaningful pursuit, replacing social interactions\n\nExternal factors of ongoing burnout:\n\nHigh work demands\nLeadership and collaboration issues\nConflicting instructions\nTime constraints and urgency\nHostile work environment, including bullying\nLimited decision-making freedom\nInadequate influence on work organization\nLimited participation opportunities\nRestricted autonomy in expressing opinions\nHierarchy-related challenges\nIneffective internal communication between employers and employees\nAdministrative limitations\nPressure exerted by superiors\nEscalating responsibilities\nInefficient work organization\nScarcity of resources (staff, funding)\nDysfunctional institutional regulations\nPerceived absence of promotion at work\nUnclear job roles\nDeficient positive reinforcement\nInadequate team synergy\nLack of social support\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The type of burnout, as outlined by Kaschka, Korczak, and Broich (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested by Moss et al. (2019) in the Harvard Business Review, burnout is a workplace-related issue, not merely individual problems. Annually, the United States spend approximately USD 190 billion due to workplace stress, nearly 8% of their national healthcare expenditure. Beyond economic cost, workplace stress also poses an imminent danger, contributing to 120,000 deaths each year (Goh, Pfeffer, and Zenios 2016). A study involving 375 stressed employees from the Australian mining sector revealed that 23.4% had missed work due to health issues, and 6.7% struggled to focus at work because of health problems in the past month. On average, stressed employees’ work efficiency decreased by 33.6%, resulting in an average cost of USD 45,000 per employee. Notably, persistent work-related stress significantly escalated costs, far surpassing those with occasional or moderate stress, emphasizing the substantial impact of stress on productivity (Street, Lacey, and Somoray 2018). Insufficient social support leads to heightened stress, while higher job performance correlates with reduced stress levels. Work-life conflict significantly contributes to workplace stress, which may increase the perceived stress level. This underscores the challenge organizations face in balancing flexible work setups and optimal performance, where prolonged exposure to work-related stress negatively affects performance and well-being. Conversely, fostering a supportive work environment and promoting social interaction and organizational support can alleviate stress. Leaders focusing on the work environment and encouraging social support play a crucial role in diminishing employee stress levels (Foy et al. 2019).",

    "text": "Attachment Theory, as proposed by Bowlby (1973), revolves around the importance of attachment-based strategies in managing emotions. It explores how various interactions with important individuals mold these strategies. Bowlby suggested that infants possess inherent attachment behaviors geared toward seeking closeness to supportive figures, serving as a primary strategy to alleviate distress and foster a feeling of security. The theory highlights the evolutionary significance of this attachment system, aiding the survival of infants reliant on caregivers due to their limitations. Bowlby stressed that this system operates across an individual’s lifespan, shaping behaviors related to seeking support. He outlined three key roles for an attachment figure: maintaining proximity, offering a secure haven for comfort during distress, and providing a secure base for exploration and growth.\nBowlby also emphasized individual differences in attachment functioning, noting that responsive and available interactions foster a sense of security, while unavailability leads to negative self-perceptions and alternative strategies for managing emotions beyond seeking closeness. These variations give rise to attachment styles, initially categorized as secure, anxious, and avoidant in infancy, which later evolve into a two-dimensional space based on attachment anxiety and avoidance in adult relationships. The secure style reflects low levels of anxiety and avoidance, indicating comfort with intimacy and assurance in relationships. Anxious attachment indicates high anxiety and low avoidance, displaying a strong need for closeness coupled with fear of rejection. Conversely, the avoidant style represents high avoidance, signaling a preference for independence and emotional distance.\nBoth anxious and avoidant styles signify the failure of seeking closeness to ease distress, leading to secondary strategies for managing emotions. Bowlby’s theory suggests that seeking closeness serves as the primary strategy for regulating emotions, with attachment experiences shaping additional strategies. This comprehension illuminates the complexities of emotional regulation and its influence on relationships, stemming from early interactions and impacting behavior throughout an individual’s life (Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg 2003). Activation of the attachment style in adult corresponds to the imminent threat and perceived danger, as shown by figure 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Activation and dynamics of the attachment system proposed by Mikulincer, Gillath, and Shaver (2002)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a general context, eliciting negative affect will produce different behaviors among people with secure and insecure attachment styles, specifically for sociotropic and autonomous stressors. Sociotropic stressors are those related to interpersonal loss and social rejection, while autonomous stressors are those emerging from the violation of one’s internal standards. Though no strong justification in drawing a clear boundary between sociotropic and autonomous stressors, especially due to their interrelatedness, different patterns emerge when the stressors are perceived by subjects with different attachment styles. People exhibiting insecure attachment styles, whether dismissive or anxious, showed greater susceptibility to sociotropic events. Dismissive individuals, owing to their detached and emotionally distant behavior, faced increased vulnerability to future sociotropic events, resulting in interpersonal difficulties. Conversely, anxious individuals might undergo heightened distress levels because they interpret conflicts as signs of emotional connection, leading to strain in their interpersonal relationships (Bottonari et al. 2007).",

    "text": "Resilience can be seen as a trait or a state of a human psyche, where resilience as a trait covers contributing internal factors that help the individual to overcome adversities. As a state, resilience is best defined as a dynamic adaptive behavior that emerges due to circumstantial changes. Several constituents of resilience as a trait includes habitual effective coping mechanism and positive emotions, both act as a buffer against negative life events (Davydov et al. 2010). Meanwhile, as a state, resilience is a dynamic capacity to adapt supported by the interaction of internal and external factors, including biological, psychological, social, and ecological systems (Ungar and Theron 2020). Resilience as a trait is observable as a non-adaptive countermeasures, where the individual will act against the stressful events, i.e. being resistant to adversities. On the other hand, resilience as state is an adaptive transformation to prevent persistent dysfunction or psychopathology (Davydov et al. 2010), thus, will be better suited for any modelling and policy-directed research.\nThe intertwining facade of the trait and state of resilience is explainable as an inherent activities of neurocircuitries (Rutten et al. 2013), where gene-environmental interactions play a role in determining individual susceptibility to psychiatric illness (resilience as a trait) (Amstadter, Myers, and Kendler 2014). Also, there exists biological mechanism that allow experience-dependant plasticity and fuel up adaptability (resilience as a state) (Derakhshan 2020; Rutten et al. 2013). By considering both sides of resilience, This research is concerned with the latter aspect, where maintaining an adaptive behavior is of essence to abate the development of mental disorder.",

    "text": "The mechanisms underlying the neurobiology of resilience involve intricate neural circuits governing stress response and reward experiences. Feedback mechanisms within the brain and body regulate stress reactions, pivotal for sustained health and reducing mental health disturbances post-severe adversities. Major neural systems controlling stress response include the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system, and dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. Activation of the HPA axis triggers the release of hormones like corticotrophin releasing hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone, leading to the production of glucocorticoids. While short-term elevation of cortisol aids adaptive behavior, prolonged high cortisol levels can impede neurogenesis. The neurocircuitry governing reward experiences centers on mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways from the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). This system integrates sensory input and cognitive control, regulating dopamine release in the VTA. Connections with other brain regions contribute to the activity of this circuitry (Rutten et al. 2013).\nTogether with HPA axis, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a key role in stress response, where hyperactive mPFC generate depression-like behavior. The hippocampus, crucial for regulating the stress response, demonstrates vulnerability to stress; its dysfunction is associated with depression, and circuits from the hippocampus to other brain areas influence resilience to stress. GABAergic receptors in the hippocampus and dopaminergic pathways from the VTA to the NAc impact stress resilience, where impaired GABAergic neurons in the NAc elicits depression-like behaviors. Stress during early life can have lasting effects on mental health, yet mild stress exposure early on might enhance resilience. As such, adverse childhood experiences correlate with increased risk for psychological and physical diseases later in life, while stress inoculation during childhood may improve resilience (Liu et al. 2018).\nFurthermore, an aberrant regulation within cellular and molecular levels can influence resilience or stress response, emphasizing the role of genetic and environmental factors. Genetic moderation of environmental sensitivity explains individual responses to similar environments, revealing interactions between genes and environment as critical for outcomes. Stressful events can heighten psychiatric risk in individuals carrying specific gene variants like 5HTT, FKBP5, and CRH1. Epigenetics, regulating gene transcription independent of DNA sequence, profoundly influences adaptation to external stimuli. Mechanisms like DNA methylation and chromatin structure changes impact brain development, neurogenesis, and cognitive functions like memory and learning, implying its role in individual stress responses. Epigenetic mechanisms underpin individual variation in response to environmental exposures, influencing neurobiological processes during development and aging (Rutten et al. 2013).\nA healthy response to stress is crucial for long-term well-being and reduced mental health issues following exposure to severe adversity. Critical neural systems governing stress responses, including the HPA axis, the sympathetic nervous system, and neurotransmitter systems like dopamine and serotonin, play pivotal roles. Genetic factors contribute significantly to how individuals respond to stress in the same environment, illustrating the interplay between genetics and the environment. Mechanisms influenced by experiences at cellular, subcellular, and molecular levels shape the way experiences are imprinted, impacting neural adaptability and sensitivity. While human studies emphasize the importance of social networks and positive experiences in resilience, replicating these in animal models remains a challenge. Resilience isn’t just an absence of risk; it comprises distinct biological and psychological traits that aid successful adaptation or swift recovery from adversity-induced mental health issues. Exposure to multiple adverse events during development can sensitize an individual’s behavior and central nervous system, potentially leading to susceptibility to psychiatric disorders (Vella, Pai, et al. 2019).",

    "text": "Resilience is the moderator between risk factors and psychological disorders, therefore, a clear definition of included stressors will aid in developing an explainable and generalizable study design (Ungar and Theron 2020). Defining the stressors also allow us to measure resilience using a reactivity approach, where resilience is evaluated as growing tolerance to regular stress (Davydov et al. 2010). This way we can partly assess the dynamic process in developing an adaptive behavior.\nThe presence of stressors disrupts physiological function to a lower utility state (Oken, Chamine, and Wakeland 2015). Following the methods proposed by Veer et al. (2021), our research evaluates two distinct groups of stressor, namely the general daily stressor and health-related stressor. The general stressor is an instrument comprising ten items of daily hassles and life events, while the health-related stressor consists of items reflecting adversity related to general health concern in self, families, and close relatives. Any item rated as \"TRUE\" is then weighted for the severity, ranging from not burdensome (0) to substantially burdensome (5). Below is the excerpt of the general stressor items:\n\nNegative political events\nConflicts with relatives or colleagues\nFinancial problems\nPhysical health problems\nMental health problems\nBurdensome experiences with family\nBurdensome experiences in workplace\nConflicts with strangers\nSeparation from a loved one, which triggers reduced social contact and loneliness\nDeath of a loved one\n\nThe health-related stressor in Veer et al. (2021) was particularly narrating distress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In brief, these items are comprised of trepidation or perceived burden due to a disease, thus adaptable for a more general research context.",

    "text": "Depression, anxiety, and burnout are selected as outcomes of interest due to the relatedness between burnout \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) depression and burnout \\(\\rightleftharpoons\\) anxiety (Koutsimani, Montgomery, and Georganta 2019). The partial correlations have a moderate effect size, signifying the boundary between burnout and depression also burnout and anxiety. Therefore, statistically, each of depression, anxiety, and burnout does not share similar latent construct even though they have closely-related manifests. This is interpretable as distinctive remarks to differentiate three of such outcomes and the clinical importance of examining the others when one is present.\nBurnout is a condition of increasing depersonalization and emotional exhaustion, leading to reduced personal accomplishment in the workplace (sense of inefficacy). Burnout often happens due to a long-term ongoing stressor, where the inability to cope with external issues decreases work engagement (Schaufeli 2017). The incidence of burnout overlaps with psychological distress, marked by depressive symptoms or anxiety.\nIn a recent finding, burnout is partially explainable by depression and anxiety. Depression symptoms pose similar characteristics to exhaustion and depersonalization, while anxiety is related to the sense of personal inefficacy (Golonka et al. 2019). In theory, depression is marked by the loss of energy (fatigue) and anxiety is marked by being excessively worried; but a study suggested the presence of anxious depression (Gaspersz et al. 2018), which in turn also implies a pathophysiological overlap between depression and anxiety. Moreover, lower brain connectivity in the default mode network is a curious co-occurrence between depression (Jacob et al. 2020), anxiety (Imperatori et al. 2019), and burnout (Shang et al. 2022). Neurobiological, clinical, and contextual overlaps between depression, anxiety, and burnout necessitate the inclusion of these outcomes to infer a more general impact of associated stressors.\nSeveral policies have been implemented to alleviate the mental health burden in Indonesia, mainly highlighted in the Mental Health Act in 2014 (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021), and further defined in the Indonesian Minister of Health Regulation Number 77 of 2015 and Indonesian Minister of Health Regulation Number 54 of 2017 (Hartono, Mandowen, and Asmorowati 2018). During the pandemic, the government of Indonesia has stipulated a Presidential Decree R1 No. 7 of 2020 to promptly respond the pandemic; however, the practical implementation has not addressed mental health issues. Though, several ongoing initiatives led by the government has been realized as a regulation on managing a digital counselling platform (Tampubolon, Silalahi, and Siagian 2021). The digital platform, conducted through various chat-based and video call-based application, helps the general population to get in touch with therapists, psychologists, counselors, and educational practitioners (Ifdil et al. 2020). Tele-consulting, either through chat or video call, enables practitioners to provide psychological first aid to address elevated distress during the pandemic, depression, and anxiety (Ifdil et al. 2020).",

You will find several resources I neatly arranged in the learning space, where I note down topics that enriched my research.\n\n\nWhat are you doing here?\nI will leave the answer to this question at your discretion. Though, if you are unhappy with my work, I would always warmly welcome any critique, thought, and suggestion. This site is equipped with Giscus and hypothes.is, so anyone should be able to jot their ideas down in any place they deem fitting. To annotate or highlight using hypothes.is, you simply need to block a text with the cursor, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Using hypothes.is, kindly ensure that you have registered an account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
